## RESEARCH EXPERIENCE

### Founder & Principal Investigator | CrisPRO.ai
**August 2023 – Present**

Developing an AI-powered oncology co-pilot for precision drug development and clinical research. Key research contributions:

**Metastasis Interception Framework**
- Built stage-aware CRISPR design system targeting 8 metastatic cascade steps (EMT → colonization)
- Integrated Evo2-1B sequence disruption, pathway essentiality, chromatin accessibility, and regulatory signals
- Validated against 38 metastatic genes; per-step AUROC 0.976 ± 0.035, Precision@3 = 1.000
- 1000-bootstrap CIs (seed=42); Fisher's exact p<0.001 for 6/8 steps; Cohen's d >2.0

**Drug Efficacy Prediction (S/P/E Framework)**
- Developed multi-modal framework combining Sequence (Evo2), Pathway (KEGG aggregation), and Evidence (ClinVar, PharmGKB)
- Achieved 70-85% prediction confidence vs. 50-60% for single-metric approaches
- Extended to VUS classification in DDR genes (BRCA1/2, RAD51C/D, PALB2, ATM, CHEK2, MBD4)

**Cohort-Scale Validations**
- 995 multiple myeloma patients: DIS3 mutations → 2.08× mortality risk (p=0.0145)
- 469 ovarian cancer patients: MAPK mutations → 1.97× platinum resistance (p<0.05, FDR-corrected)

**Resistance Prediction**
- Built multi-signal resistance detection system (DNA repair restoration, pathway escape)
- Deployed mechanism-based trial matching using 7D pathway vectors
