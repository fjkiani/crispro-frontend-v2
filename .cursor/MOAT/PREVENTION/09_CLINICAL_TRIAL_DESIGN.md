# 09 — Clinical Trial Design (DDR_bin-Guided Umbrella)

**Purpose:** Turn Stage-3 prevention into a defendable clinical validation plan.

---

## Trial Concept

**Population:** Patients starting PARP inhibitor (or DDR-targeted regimen)  
**Biomarker:** DDR_bin computed serially  
**Trigger:** DDR_bin crosses threshold (Manager-defined)

---

## Design Options

### **Option A: Randomized at trigger (preferred)**
- Monitor all participants
- When trigger occurs, randomize:
  - Arm 1: standard care (continue)
  - Arm 2: intervention (adaptive / combo / trial-first)

### **Option B: Single-arm feasibility**
- Apply intervention at trigger
- Primary: feasibility + safety + biomarker trajectory

---

## Endpoints

- **Primary:** time-to-progression (RECIST + CA-125)
- **Secondary:** DDR_bin trajectory, ctDNA VAF changes
- **Exploratory:** OS, QoL

---

## Required Manager Inputs

- Threshold policy (trigger definition)
- Chosen Tier-1 intervention
- Power assumptions (effect size) and target N
- Regulatory stance (RUO vs clinical tool)
