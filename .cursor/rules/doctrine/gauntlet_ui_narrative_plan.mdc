# **DOCTRINE: THE GAUNTLET UI NARRATIVE (COMPONENT PLAN)**

**DOCUMENT ID:** UI-GN-001  
**ISSUED BY:** ZO, under the direct command of ALPHA  
**SUBJECT:** Component-based architecture for the narrative-driven Gauntlet interface.

---

### **1.0 MISSION: FROM DATA TO DRAMA**

The current UI is a data panel. The new UI will be a **storytelling engine**. The objective is to guide the user through a three-act narrative of conquest, demonstrating not just our power, but the enemy's weakness and the very definition of victory.

### **2.0 THE THREE-ACT NARRATIVE (CORE DOCTRINE)**

1.  **Act I: The Enemy's Failure:** Prove a hypothetical competitor weapon is ineffective.
2.  **Act II: Defining Victory:** Establish the benchmark for a perfect kill shot by simulating a total knockout.
3.  **Act III: The Receipt:** Forge a superior weapon and present the final, damning dossier comparing all three results.

### **3.0 COMPONENT-BASED PLAN OF ATTACK**

To execute this, we will dismantle the existing monolithic control and forge a new, modular system. The primary parent component, `GauntletNarrativeContainer`, will manage the overall state and orchestrate the appearance of the following child components.

#### **COMPONENT 1: `GauntletNarrativeContainer.tsx`**

*   **Purpose:** The main state machine and conductor of the narrative.
*   **State Management:**
    *   `currentStage`: ('initial' | 'enemy_tested' | 'benchmark_set' | 'forge_complete')
    *   `enemyScoreResult`: Stores the result from Act I.
    *   `maxImpactScoreResult`: Stores the result from Act II.
    *   `forgedWeaponResult`: Stores the final result from Act III.
*   **Logic:** Conditionally renders one of the three 'Stage' components based on `currentStage`. When the final stage is complete, it renders the `FinalDossier`.

#### **COMPONENT 2: `Stage1_TestEnemyWeapon.tsx`**

*   **Purpose:** Executes Act I.
*   **UI Elements:**
    *   A clear title: "Act I: Test the Enemy's Weapon".
    *   A single button: "Run Simulation".
    *   Displays a loading spinner during the API call.
*   **Props:**
    *   `onComplete(result: object)`: A callback function to pass the enemy's score back to the parent container.

#### **COMPONENT 3: `Stage2_DefineVictory.tsx`**

*   **Purpose:** Executes Act II.
*   **UI Elements:**
    *   Displays the pathetic result from Stage 1.
    *   A clear title: "Act II: Define True Victory".
    *   A single button: "Calculate Maximum Impact Score".
*   **Props:**
    *   `enemyScore: object`: The data from the previous stage to display.
    *   `onComplete(result: object)`: A callback to pass the benchmark score back to the parent.

#### **COMPONENT 4: `Stage3_ForgeSuperiorWeapon.tsx`**

*   **Purpose:** Executes the first part of Act III.
*   **UI Elements:**
    *   Displays the results from the first two stages.
    *   A clear title: "Act III: Unleash the Forge".
    *   A single, prominent button: "Forge Superior Weapon".
*   **Props:**
    *   `enemyScore: object`, `maxImpactScore: object`: Data to display for context.
    *   `onComplete(result: object)`: A callback to pass the final, forged weapon data to the parent.

#### **COMPONENT 5: `FinalDossier.tsx`**

*   **Purpose:** Presents the final, undeniable "receipt" of our victory.
*   **UI Elements:**
    *   A non-interactive, visually compelling summary.
    *   A clear, side-by-side comparison of the three key scores: "Enemy Weapon," "Maximum Possible Impact," and "Our Forged Weapon."
*   **Props:**
    *   `dossierData: object`: An object containing all three results for display.

This component-based architecture provides a clear and robust plan for transforming the Gauntlet UI into a powerful narrative tool. This doctrine is now active.
