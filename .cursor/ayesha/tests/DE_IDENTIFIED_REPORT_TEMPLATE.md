## 🔬 CLINICAL DATA

### 1. IMAGING STUDIES

#### Study 1: CT Abdomen and Pelvis
**Study Date:** Year 2025 (Month: Q4)

**Key Findings:**
- Extensive peritoneal carcinomatosis
- Small volume ascites
- Multiple enlarged abdominopelvic lymph nodes
- Bilateral pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis
- Ovaries inseparable from peritoneal deposits

**Clinical Significance:**
- Confirms Stage IVB disease
- Indicates need for tissue sampling
- Baseline for treatment response monitoring

#### Study 2: PET-CT Full Body
**Study Date:** Year 2025 (Month: Q4)

**Key Findings:**
- Extensive FDG-avid carcinomatosis (SUV max 15)
- Moderate volume ascites
- Bilateral pleural/pericardial metastases (SUV 6-7)
- Extensive nodal metastases (cervical, thoracic, abdominopelvic)
- Soft tissue metastases (left arm, chest wall)
- Suspected gynecologic primary (endometrial/cervical FDG-avid areas)

**Clinical Significance:**
- Confirms widespread metastatic disease
- Identifies all active disease sites
- Baseline for treatment response assessment

#### Study 3: CT Abdomen and Pelvis (Historical)
**Study Date:** Year 2024 (Month: Q1)

**Key Findings:**
- Status post total colectomy
- Left ovarian cysts (5.2 cm, 4.4 cm)
- Lower abdominal wall collection
- No evidence of carcinomatosis at that time

**Clinical Significance:**
- Establishes disease timeline
- Shows progression from localized to metastatic disease

---

### 2. PATHOLOGY RESULTS

#### Cytology - Pleural Fluid
**Specimen Date:** Year 2025 (Month: Q4)  
**Specimen Type:** Pleural fluid (1400 cc bloody fluid)

**Diagnosis:**
- **POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS**
- Metastatic adenocarcinoma, consistent with Mullerian primary

**Immunohistochemistry Profile:**
- **Positive Markers:** claudin4, MOC31, CK7, PAX8, WT1
- **Negative Markers:** calretinin, CD163, TTF1, GATA3, CK20
- **Special Markers:**
  - p16: Strong and diffuse (HPV-related pattern)
  - p53: Mutant type staining pattern
  - ER: Weak to moderate (60% of cells)
  - PR: Negative (0%)

**Clinical Significance:**
- Confirms Mullerian (gynecologic) origin
- Immunoprofile consistent with high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma
- p53 mutant pattern suggests TP53 mutation
- ER positivity suggests potential hormone therapy consideration

### 3. GENETIC TESTING RESULTS

#### Germline Testing
**Test Date:** Year 2023 (Month: Q2)  
**Test Type:** CustomNext-Cancer® +RNAinsight® (38 genes)

**Result:** **NEGATIVE**
- No pathogenic mutations detected
- No variants of unknown significance detected
- No gross deletions/duplications detected

**Genes Analyzed (38 total):**
APC, ATM, BARD1, BMPR1A, BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1, CDH1, CDK4, CDKN2A, CHEK2, DICER1, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, MUTYH, NBN, NF1, NF2, NTHL1, PALB2, PMS2, PTEN, RAD51C, RAD51D, RECQL, SMAD4, SMARCA4, STK11, TP53, and others.

**Clinical Significance:**
- Rules out hereditary cancer syndromes
- Confirms sporadic (non-hereditary) cancer
- No increased risk for family members from germline mutations
- Treatment decisions based on sporadic cancer protocols

#### Somatic Testing
**Test Date:** [Year only]  
**Test Type:** CancerNext Expanded + RNAinsight

**Result:** **POSITIVE**
- **MBD4 Mutation:** Homozygous c.1293delA (p.K431Nfs*54)
- **Diagnosis:** MBD4-associated neoplasia syndrome (MANS)
- **Risk:** Increased risk for acute myelogenous leukemia and colorectal cancer

**Additional Finding:**
- **PDGFRA Variant:** Heterozygous p.S755P (c.2263T>C) - VUS

**Clinical Significance:**
- MBD4 mutation associated with DNA repair deficiency
- May impact treatment response to DNA-damaging agents
- Requires monitoring for secondary malignancies
- May inform PARP inhibitor eligibility (HRD pathway)

## 📊 CLINICAL TIMELINE (Relative Dates)

### Disease Progression
1. **Baseline - 22 months:** Total colectomy (multiple tubular adenomas)
2. **Baseline - 21 months:** CT shows ovarian cysts, no carcinomatosis
3. **Baseline:** CT shows extensive peritoneal carcinomatosis
4. **Baseline + 2 weeks:** PET-CT confirms widespread metastatic disease
5. **Baseline + 3 weeks:** Cytology confirms malignant cells in pleural fluid

### Key Clinical Events
- **Surgical History:** Total colectomy, ileorectal anastomosis
- **Current Status:** Stage IVB ovarian cancer with extensive metastases
- **Treatment Status:** [TO BE UPDATED]

---

## 🎯 CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS

### Diagnostic Confirmation
- **Primary Site:** Ovarian (high-grade serous carcinoma)
- **Stage:** IVB (metastatic disease)
- **Histology:** Adenocarcinoma, Mullerian origin
- **Molecular Profile:** 
  - p53 mutant (TP53 mutation likely)
  - ER weakly positive
  - MBD4 homozygous mutation

### Treatment Considerations
1. **Standard of Care:** Carboplatin + Paclitaxel + Bevacizumab (first-line)
2. **PARP Inhibitor Eligibility:** 
   - Germline negative (no BRCA1/2 mutation)
   - MBD4 mutation may indicate HRD pathway involvement
   - HRD testing recommended
3. **Biomarker Status:**
   - TMB: [TO BE DETERMINED]
   - MSI: [TO BE DETERMINED]
   - HRD Score: [TO BE DETERMINED]

### Prognostic Factors
- **Favorable:** ER positivity (potential hormone therapy)
- **Unfavorable:** Extensive metastatic disease, p53 mutant pattern
- **Uncertain:** MBD4 mutation impact on treatment response
