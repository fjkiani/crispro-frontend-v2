## 🧬 CrisPRO.ai MOAT Contribution: VUS Resolution (ClinVar + Evo2 + Pathway Context)

> **Note for Other Agents**: This section covers the VUS Resolution MOAT — turning “Variant of Uncertain Significance” into an auditable, pathway-aware disposition using a single endpoint (`/api/vus/identify`). Other agents should add their sections for: Drug Efficacy (WIWFM/S-P-E), Therapy Fit, SAE Intelligence, Trial Matching, Toxicity Risk, CRISPR Co‑Pilot, and the Integrated Platform. Each agent owns their capability section.

### Where VUS Resolution Fits in the Drug Development Pipeline

**Mapping to FDA's 5-Step Process:**

| FDA Step | Traditional Gap / Pain Point | VUS Resolution Contribution |
|----------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Step 1: Discovery & Development** | Target discovery and patient stratification depend on genomics, but ~40% of variants are VUS → uncertainty blocks mechanism hypotheses | **Pathway-aware VUS triage** — identify if a VUS is likely damaging and whether it’s relevant to the actionable axis (DDR/MAPK/PI3K/etc.) |
| **Step 2: Preclinical Research** | Preclinical hypotheses get built on shaky variant interpretation; labs waste cycles chasing noise | **Noise neutralization** — rapidly downgrade/contain passenger variants and elevate likely-damaging candidates with provenance + “next actions” |
| **Step 3: Clinical Research** | Trial enrollment suffers when molecular eligibility is ambiguous (VUS blocks biomarker cohorts) | **Structured, auditable disposition** — consistent outputs (verdict, confidence, resolution path) that can feed protocol stratification (RUO) |
| **Step 4: FDA Drug Review** | Sponsors must justify biomarker logic; VUS interpretation is inconsistent and hard to audit | **Audit-ready VUS evidence packet** — local ClinVar prior + Evo2 min_delta + pathway relevance + run provenance; deterministic handling of failures |
| **Step 5: Post-Marketing Monitoring** | Variant reinterpretation occurs over time; hard to reproduce what was believed at approval | **Provenance + reproducibility** — run IDs, input snapshots, and resolution_path allow longitudinal tracking of reinterpretations |

---

### What We Built (Core Capability)

#### 1) One-Call VUS Endpoint

- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/vus/identify`
- **Inputs (flexible)**: HGVS (gene, hgvs_c/hgvs_p) or coordinates (chrom, pos, ref, alt) + assembly
- **Outputs (structured)**:
  - `coverage.clinvar` (prior; local index)
  - `sequence.min_delta` (Evo2 delta-only scoring; with windows attempted)
  - `triage` (verdict + confidence + reasons + resolution_path)
  - `pathway_context` (variant axis, patient axis, pathway_relevance)
  - `next_actions` (WIWFM, trials, dossier, cohort context)
  - `provenance` (run_id + per-service call receipts)

#### 2) Resolution Rubric (Prior vs ML)

- **ClinVar prior**: if decisive → use as prior signal
- **Evo2 ML scoring**: if prior is non-decisive/absent → score and resolve by magnitude of disruption (`min_delta`)
- **Pathway context**: “is this variant relevant for *this* patient axis?” to prevent false urgency

### Concrete Receipt (Real Output)

**Example output artifact (RAD51C chr17:58709872 T>C, GRCh38)**:
- **File**: `oncology-coPilot/oncology-backend-minimal/results/vus_demo_blog/20251215-162249/case1_rad51c.res.json`

Key fields (abridged):
- `coverage.clinvar.status`: `"Uncertain significance"` (local index)
- `sequence.min_delta`: `-0.087150...` (Evo2 called, success)
- `triage.status`: `"resolved_by_evo2"`
- `triage.verdict`: `"Likely damaging (ML)"`
- `triage.resolution_path`: `"evo2"`
- `pathway_context.patient_actionable_axis`: `"DDR"`
- `pathway_context.pathway_relevance`: `"high"`
- `provenance.run_id`: present; per-service call receipts included

### Validated / Grounded Metrics (What We Can Claim)

#### Variant Foundation Metrics (Evo2)

| Metric | Value | Significance |
|--------|-------|--------------|
| **ClinVar AUROC** | **0.957** (n=53,210) | Strong baseline for variant impact classification |
| **SpliceVarDB AUROC** | **~0.825–0.826** (n=4,950) | Supports splice/regulatory risk signals |
| **Evo2 context window** | **1M tokens** | Enables large-window sequence context for scoring |

#### Operational Guarantees (System-Level)

| Property | What We Do | Why It Matters |
|---------|------------|----------------|
| **Single-call triage** | One request returns priors + ML delta + pathway context + next actions | Low friction; consistent outputs |
| **Auditability** | `provenance.run_id` + per-service call receipts | Reproducible evidence packet |
| **Failure transparency** | Explicit `evo2_success`, insight stub warnings, and call receipts | Prevents silent hallucination |
| **Assembly handling** | Carry `assembly`; avoid mixing GRCh37/38 when scoring | Reduces allele mismatch errors |

### How We Accelerate Each Phase

#### Step 1: Discovery & Development → Convert “unknown” into mechanism hypotheses

**Problem:** Genomic stratification is blocked by VUS ambiguity.

**Our Solution:**
```
/api/vus/identify:
├── ClinVar prior (local index) → decisive vs non-decisive
├── Evo2 scoring → min_delta + windows attempted
├── Triage rubric → verdict + confidence + resolution_path
├── Pathway context → axis + relevance to patient axis
└── Next actions → WIWFM / trials / dossier / cohort context
```

**Impact:** Programs stop treating VUS as “dead ends” and start treating them as auditable hypotheses, prioritized by pathway relevance.

---

#### Step 2: Preclinical Research → Reduce wasted wet-lab cycles

**Problem:** Labs chase variants that are either benign noise or irrelevant to the actionable mechanism.

**Our Solution:**
- **Neutralize noise**: fast “benign/low relevance” disposition where priors and ML agree
- **Escalate signal**: “likely damaging (ML)” when prior is non-decisive but Evo2 signal is strong
- **Attach next steps**: immediate WIWFM, trial matching, dossier export

**Impact:** Fewer junk experiments; clearer prioritization for functional assays.

---

#### Step 3: Clinical Research → Consistent patient stratification artifacts (RUO)

**Problem:** Phase 2 is the bottleneck (28.9% success); stratification logic is often noisy.

**Our Solution:**
- Standardized, structured VUS disposition fields suitable for protocol support (RUO)
- Pathway axis + relevance to avoid enrolling mechanistically irrelevant VUS

**Impact:** Cleaner eligibility narratives and better mechanistic cohorting.

---

#### Step 4: FDA Drug Review → Evidence packet with provenance

**Problem:** Regulators need consistent, auditable biomarker logic.

**Our Solution:**
- **Local ClinVar prior**: stable and reproducible
- **ML disruption signal**: `min_delta` (with explicit success/failure)
- **Pathway context**: “why this matters” mapped to actionable axis
- **Provenance**: run_id + call receipts to show exactly what was queried

**Impact:** “Show your work” biomarker justification becomes systematic instead of ad hoc.

---

#### Step 5: Post-Marketing Monitoring → Track reinterpretation over time

**Problem:** Variant classifications change; without provenance you can’t reconstruct prior decisions.

**Our Solution:**
- Run manifests (`run_id`, `resolution_path`, service call receipts)
- Same variant can be re-run later and compared deterministically

**Impact:** Longitudinal audit trail for reinterpretation and learning loops.

### Novel Contributions (What’s Hard to Copy)

#### 1) “Prior vs ML” resolution with explicit `resolution_path`
Most tools either trust ClinVar blindly or output a generic ML score. We output *which* resolution route was used (`prior` vs `evo2`) with receipts.

#### 2) Patient-axis gating
We don’t just ask “is it damaging?” — we ask “is it damaging *and* relevant to the actionable axis?”

#### 3) Receipts-first outputs
Every call includes provenance and per-service call status, making it possible to debug and defend the output.

### Current Limitations (Transparent)

| Limitation | Status | Resolution Path |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| Clinical outcome validation | Not claimed | Future: correlate resolved VUS with response/eligibility outcomes |
| Insight chips availability | Some services can stub/fail | Improve robustness; ensure real Enformer/insights deployment |
| Coverage beyond ClinVar + Evo2 | Limited | Add more priors (functional assays, curated datasets) |
| Pathway mapping breadth | DDR-first focus | Expand to additional axes and refine weights |

### Instructions for Other Agents

- Add your capability section in the same format: **Pipeline mapping → metrics → phase acceleration → limitations → instructions**.
- Keep claims honest: separate “validated” metrics from “operational” guarantees.
