# Code Example 7 (yaml)

**Category**: pattern
**Priority**: P2
**Source**: Chat log lines 244-322

---

  Goal: Prove CA-125 kinetics work for onset detection
  Timeline: 2-3 weeks (Jan 10-31)
  Risk: Low (data accessible, proven methods)
  Deliverable: PLCO validation report (AUROC, lead time)

TRACK 2: Treatment Cohort Acquisition (True Validation)
  Owner: Agent 3
  Goal: Acquire serial CA-125 + resistance outcomes
  Timeline: 4-8 weeks (Jan 10 - Feb 28)
  Risk: Medium (depends on collaborator response)
  Deliverable: Treatment cohort data + DUA

TRACK 3: WIWFM Validation (Proven Product)
  Owner: Agent 1 (or Agent 3 after S2-S4 complete)
  Goal: Validate drug efficacy predictions (7 pathways)
  Timeline: 2-3 weeks (Jan 17 - Feb 7)
  Risk: Low (data available, proven framework)
  Deliverable: WIWFM validation report (pathway alignment)

INTEGRATION POINTS:
  Week 2 (Jan 10): PLCO approved → Track 1 starts
  Week 3 (Jan 17): PLCO kinetics done → Track 3 starts
  Week 4-6 (Jan 24 - Feb 7): Track 2 data arrives → True RP validation
```

## **DECISION TREE**

NOW (Week 1):
  Agent 2: Build harness (D3) + synthetic validation
  Agent 3: Execute S4 (data source mapping) + finish S2
  Agent 1: On hold (Week 3 start)

JAN 10 (Week 2):
  IF PLCO approved:
    Agent 2: Download + validate PLCO kinetics (A1-A3)
    Agent 3: Contact collaborators (S4 outreach)
  
  IF PLCO not approved:
    Agent 2: Continue harness work
    Agent 3: Continue S4 (find alternative data)

JAN 17 (Week 3):
  IF PLCO kinetics validated:
    Agent 2: Write PLCO report
    Agent 3: Await collaborator responses
    Agent 1: START WIWFM validation (TCGA-OV)
  
  IF PLCO kinetics failed:
    Honest assessment: Why failed?
    Pivot: Focus on WIWFM (proven) + await treatment cohort

JAN 31 - FEB 28 (Week 4-8):
  IF Treatment cohort acquired:
    Agent 2 + 3: TRUE Resistance Prophet validation
    Agent 1: Complete WIWFM validation
  
  IF Treatment cohort delayed:
    Agent 1: Complete WIWFM validation
    Agent 2 + 3: Continue outreach, prepare for data arrival

FINAL DELIVERABLES (Feb 28):
  1. PLCO kinetics report (onset detection)
  2. WIWFM validation report (drug efficacy, 7 pathways)
  3. Treatment cohort access secured OR in progress
  4. Resistance Prophet validation (if cohort acquired)
```
