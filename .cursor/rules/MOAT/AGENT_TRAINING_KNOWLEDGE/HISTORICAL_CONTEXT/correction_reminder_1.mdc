# Correction/Reminder 1

```yaml
UNCLEAR:
  - Why did Resistance Prophet fail? (mysterious)
  - What data do we need? (vague "serial CA-125")
  - What's the validation path? (one big validation)

RISK:
  - Might pursue wrong data sources
  - Might expect PLCO to validate full hypothesis
  - Might not prioritize treatment cohorts
```


***

### **After S1:**

```yaml
CLEAR:
  ✅ Failure explained: Baseline can't predict adaptive
  ✅ Data priority: Serial CA-125 > MAPK baseline > ctDNA
  ✅ Validation strategy: Phase 1A/1B/1C (staged approach)
  ✅ PLCO role: Kinetics proof, not resistance validation
  ✅ Critical need: Treatment cohorts (S4 execution)

AGENT PRIORITIES UPDATED:

AGENT 2 (ENGINEER):
  OLD: Build generic harness, wait for PLCO
  NEW: Build harness for Phase 1B (kinetics-only validation)
       Focus on PLCO = proof-of-kinetics, not final answer
       Prepare for Phase 1C (when treatment cohort arrives)

AGENT 3 (SCIENTIST):
  OLD: Finish S2 (pathway-kinetic matrix)
  NEW: PRIORITIZE S4 (data source mapping) ← CRITICAL
       Phase 1C requires treatment cohort (serial CA-125 + resistance)
       S4 must identify + acquire this data ASAP
       S2 becomes secondary (literature review can wait)

AGENT 1 (THERAPY FIT):
  OLD: On hold indefinitely
  NEW: Execute Phase 1A (baseline stratification)
       This is WIWFM validation territory (drug efficacy)
       Can run NOW while waiting for Phase 1B/1C data
       Timeline: Week 3 (Jan 17 start)
```

## **REVISED AGENT ALIGNMENT (POST-S1)**

```yaml
WEEK 1-2 (NOW - JAN 10):

  AGENT 2 (ENGINEER):
    PRIMARY: D3 - Build Phase 1B harness
      - Kinetics computation (velocity, acceleration, KELIM)
      - Model training (logistic regression, random forest)
      - Validation metrics (AUROC, lead time analysis)
      - Focus: PLCO = kinetics proof, not resistance validation
    
    TIMELINE: 8-12 hours
    BLOCKING: PLCO approval (expected Jan 2-6)

  AGENT 3 (SCIENTIST):
    PRIMARY: S4 - Data source mapping (CRITICAL)
      - Treatment cohorts with serial CA-125 + resistance outcomes
      - Priority sources:
        1. GOG-218 trial (Project Data Sphere)
        2. ICON7 trial (MRC CTU)
        3. GCIG meta-analysis (Institut Curie, 5,573 patients)
        4. KELIM developers (biomarker-kinetics.org)
        5. Johns Hopkins cohort (100-300 Stage III/IV OC)
      - Draft outreach emails
      - Prepare DUA templates
      - OUTPUT: Ranked list + contact strategy
    
    SECONDARY: S2 completion (if time allows)
