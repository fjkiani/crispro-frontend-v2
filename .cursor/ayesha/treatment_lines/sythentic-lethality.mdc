description: Synthetic lethality in Multiple Myeloma – our A–B dependency technique, AI orchestration, and what it unlocks (RUO)
---

## Engineering Synthetic Lethality in Multiple Myeloma

### Executive summary
- **What we did**: Operationalized synthetic lethality discovery for Multiple Myeloma (MM) using an AI‑orchestrated A–B dependency technique that integrates Sequence/Pathway/Evidence (S/P/E), Evo2 plausibility, interpretable SAE features, and treatment‑line context.
- **How it works**: Identify gene A (tumor alteration) → infer compensatory dependency on gene B → rank drug B (or B‑pathway) while modulating confidence with real‑world treatment history and evidence gates.
- **Why it matters**: Produces transparent, mechanism‑anchored therapy hypotheses with confidence, citations, and provenance—faster than manual literature review, and adaptable to new data.
- **Privacy**: No patient identifiers. All data shown are generalized findings from our research sandbox. Research‑Use Only (RUO).

### Synthetic lethality, briefly
Synthetic lethality exploits the fact that two perturbations—A and B—are tolerated independently but lethal together. In oncology, if a tumor harbors alteration A, inhibiting B can collapse the malignant network while sparing normal cells. In practice, we use this to: (1) map A→B dependencies, (2) short‑list B‑targeting drugs, and (3) explain the mechanistic “why” behind each recommendation.

### The A–B dependency technique (our operational pattern)
- **A = Tumor alteration**: somatic mutation, copy‑number change, transcriptional program, or proteasome stressor characteristic of MM.
- **B = Compensatory dependency**: genes/pathways cancer cells become reliant on given A (derived from public dependency resources, MM biology, and our Evo2/SAE signals).
- **Therapeutic mapping**: match B to available drugs (FDA/Guideline/Trial), rank with S/P/E + SAE, modulate by treatment line and evidence strength, return confidence and rationale.

### How our AI executes it (end‑to‑end)
1) **Sequence (S) – Evo2 plausibility**
   - Score variant impact and domain context (coding and non‑coding proxies) to estimate disruption magnitude and direction.
   - Calibrate per‑gene to avoid cross‑gene scale drift; aggregate multi‑window and exon‑context signals.

2) **Pathway (P) – A→B mapping**
   - Map A to disrupted MM pathways (e.g., DNA repair, proteostasis, NF‑κB, MAPK, B‑cell programs).
   - Query dependency priors to infer candidate B nodes (genes/pathways whose inhibition is predicted to be lethal given A’s state).
   - Score pathway overlap between B‑targets and the disrupted network.

3) **Evidence (E) – literature + clinical priors**
   - Retrieve mechanism‑of‑action–aware literature; derive evidence tiers and badges (RCT/Guideline/Pathway‑Aligned) with citations and deduping.
   - Surface cohort or guideline signals when available; degrade gracefully when sparse.

4) **SAE interpretability – “why this works”**
   - Compute interpretable features (e.g., exon disruption, hotspot, essentiality signal, DNA‑repair burden, proteostasis load) and attach them to the EvidenceBand so clinicians see the mechanism behind the score.

5) **Treatment‑line context – confidence you can trust**
   - Compute line appropriateness, cross‑resistance risk, and sequencing fitness per drug.
   - Modulate confidence (e.g., reduce when prior therapies create MoA overlap risks) with transparent provenance and rationale.

### MM case study (generalized, RUO)
In our MM sandbox, we applied the A–B technique to common malignant programs:
- **Proteostasis stress (A)** → elevated reliance on **proteasome and UPR nodes (B)**. Our AI surfaced B‑targets aligned with proteasome/ER‑stress pathways and ranked drugs that intensify synthetic stress selectively in MM cells, with SAE features highlighting proteostasis burden and pathway alignment.
- **DNA repair burden (A)** → dependency on **PARP and checkpoint pathways (B)** in defined molecular contexts. When supported by S/P/E and evidence gates, B‑class agents rose in rank; otherwise the system penalized over‑reach and explained why.
- **Transcriptional addiction (A)** → dependency on **IKZF1/3 and related CRBN‑axis (B)**. The engine linked A to B‑targeting agents where MoA and pathway overlap justified consideration, with confidence modulated by prior IMiD exposure.

Rather than a single “best drug,” the system produces a ranked slate with: efficacy_score, confidence, evidence_tier, badges, insight chips, and a rationale list that connects A→B→drug with citations and per‑feature attributions.

### What “AB‑dependent” means in practice
We use “A–B dependent” to denote a conditional vulnerability: given alteration A, inhibition of B is predicted to be lethal or strongly growth‑limiting. Our stack operationalizes this by:
- Learning A→B pairs from public dependency atlases and MM‑specific literature.
- Verifying biological plausibility with Evo2 sequence/context scoring.
- Confirming pathway connectives and MoA fit.
- Adjusting confidence via treatment‑line intelligence (line fit, cross‑resistance, sequencing fitness).
- Packaging everything as auditable provenance (run_id, profile, features, citations).

### What we achieved so far (capabilities)
- **Transparent, mechanism‑anchored rankings**: Every recommendation comes with “why”—pathway matches, SAE features, and literature badges.
- **Context‑aware confidence**: Treatment history dynamically modulates confidence, preventing over‑confident calls after prior MoA exposure.
- **Profile controls**: Baseline (fast) vs Richer (deeper S/P/E+SAE) profiles, with consistent contracts for UI and reports.
- **Graceful degradation**: When external evidence is sparse, the engine is honest—lower tiers, lower confidence, clear next steps.

### Implications beyond MM
- **Portability across cancers**: The A–B pattern generalizes—swap in tumor‑specific pathways, dependency priors, and drug maps; keep the same orchestration and interpretability.
- **Combination design**: A–B pairs compose into A–B–C triplets for rational combos (orthogonal stressors with non‑overlapping toxicities).
- **Trial matching**: Mechanism‑labeled outputs map cleanly to biomarker‑driven trials and inclusion criteria.

### What’s next (roadmap)
- **Tumor‑specific inputs**: Parse tumor NGS (TMB/MSI/HRD + somatic variants) to specialize A→B in each patient’s context.
- **Expanded dependency priors**: Integrate larger CRISPR screen resources and MM‑focused perturbation data.
- **Closed‑loop learning**: Capture outcomes, recalibrate confidence, and strengthen future A–B calls.
- **Design loop**: For CRISPR concepts, pass ranked B‑targets into guide design and structure assessment for rapid RUO prototyping.
