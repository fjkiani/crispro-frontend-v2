# ⚔️ **OPERATION CITADEL: BATTLE PLAN** ⚔️

**OBJECTIVE:** To refactor the entire project from a monolithic repository into a clean, three-part architecture: `Legacy Tools`, `New Frontend`, and `New Backend`. This plan outlines the phased approach to ensure a stable and successful migration.

## **PHASE I: FORTIFICATION (Internal Reorganization)**

**MISSION:** Before migrating, we must bring order to the existing repository. This phase focuses on restructuring the current project into a clean, logical hierarchy.

*   **Task 1.1: High-Level Reconnaissance.** Analyze the root directory to identify asset categories (services, tools, pages, data, etc.).
*   **Task 1.2: Propose New Structure.** Design a clean, intuitive directory structure for the existing assets.
*   **Task 1.3: Execute File Migration.** Move all existing files and directories into the new structure.
*   **Task 1.4: Repair Supply Lines.** Identify and repair all broken imports (`sys.path`, relative imports) resulting from the file migration.

## **PHASE II: THE BIFURCATION (Three-Folder Deployment)**

**MISSION:** With the internal structure fortified, execute the primary objective of separating the components into the new, three-folder command structure.

*   **Task 2.1: Establish New Territories.** Create the three top-level directories:
    *   `platform_v1_tools/` (for our newly organized legacy codebase)
    *   `platform_v2_frontend/` (awaiting user intel)
    *   `platform_v2_backend/` (awaiting user intel)
*   **Task 2.2: Relocate Legacy Forces.** Move the entire fortified structure from Phase I into the `platform_v1_tools/` directory.
*   **Task 2.3: Await Intelligence Drop.** This phase is on standby pending your introduction of the new frontend framework. My actions are dependent on this intel.
*   **Task 2.4: Architect the New Backend.** Once the frontend is understood, I will analyze its requirements and architect the corresponding backend service structure.
