  HONEST ASSESSMENT:
    - Kinetics alone insufficient for screening cohort
    - Possible reasons: Too sparse, wrong kinetic window
    - Learn from failure: Document why
  
  PIVOT:
    - Still pursue treatment cohorts (different biology)
    - Focus on WIWFM validation (proven framework)
    - Deprioritize Resistance Prophet (needs better data)

SCENARIO C: Treatment Cohort Data Acquired

  AGENT 2 + AGENT 3:
    - TRUE Resistance Prophet validation
    - MAPK + CA-125 for resistance timing
    - Target: AUROC 0.65-0.75
    - Timeline: 2-3 weeks after data arrival
  
  WIWFM:
    - Execute in parallel OR after RP validation
```

## **INTEGRATION ARCHITECTURE**

### **Three Parallel Tracks:**

TRACK 1: PLCO Kinetics (Proof-of-Concept)
  Owner: Agent 2
  Goal: Prove CA-125 kinetics work for onset detection
  Timeline: 2-3 weeks (Jan 10-31)
  Risk: Low (data accessible, proven methods)
  Deliverable: PLCO validation report (AUROC, lead time)

TRACK 2: Treatment Cohort Acquisition (True Validation)
  Owner: Agent 3
  Goal: Acquire serial CA-125 + resistance outcomes
  Timeline: 4-8 weeks (Jan 10 - Feb 28)
  Risk: Medium (depends on collaborator response)
  Deliverable: Treatment cohort data + DUA

TRACK 3: WIWFM Validation (Proven Product)
  Owner: Agent 1 (or Agent 3 after S2-S4 complete)
  Goal: Validate drug efficacy predictions (7 pathways)
  Timeline: 2-3 weeks (Jan 17 - Feb 7)
  Risk: Low (data available, proven framework)
  Deliverable: WIWFM validation report (pathway alignment)

INTEGRATION POINTS:
  Week 2 (Jan 10): PLCO approved → Track 1 starts
  Week 3 (Jan 17): PLCO kinetics done → Track 3 starts
  Week 4-6 (Jan 24 - Feb 7): Track 2 data arrives → True RP validation
```

## **DECISION TREE**

```yaml
NOW (Week 1):
  Agent 2: Build harness (D3) + synthetic validation
