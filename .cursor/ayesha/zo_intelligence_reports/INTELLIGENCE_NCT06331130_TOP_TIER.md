## 🎯 WHY THIS TRIAL IS A GOOD FIT FOR AYESHA (LLM Analysis)

### **Clinical Trial Analysis: NCT06331130 for Ayesha Kiani**

This is an **observational, non-interventional study** designed to develop an Artificial Intelligence (AI) model from CT scan data. It does not involve any investigational drug or provide treatment. Its goal is to create a tool to predict surgical outcomes and chemo-resistance for future patients receiving standard care.

**1. Drug Mechanism Fit**
This trial does not have an investigational drug or therapeutic mechanism. It is a data collection study that observes patients like Ayesha who are undergoing standard-of-care treatment. Therefore, there is no drug mechanism to evaluate for her specific disease characteristics. The study aims to learn from patients with her presentation (Stage IVB HGSOC, extensive carcinomatosis), not to treat them with a new agent.

**2. Location Logistics**
There are **no participating sites in the NYC metro area**. The sole recruiting location for this trial is in Genova, Italy. The trial is therefore not accessible to Ayesha, regardless of her preferences for Mount Sinai, MSK, or NYU.

**3. Risk-Benefit for Ayesha**
*   **Risks**: As a non-interventional study, the physical risks are minimal to none, limited primarily to data privacy. Her clinical status (pulmonary compromise, tumor burden) does not increase the risk of participation.
*   **Benefits**: There is no direct therapeutic benefit for Ayesha. The benefit is altruistic—her data would contribute to a prognostic model that may help future patients.
*   **Eligibility**: Her ECOG 1 performance status, extensive tumor burden, and primary diagnosis make her an excellent candidate from an eligibility and data contribution standpoint. However, the lack of therapeutic benefit and geographic inaccessibility are overriding factors.

**4. Comparison to Standard of Care (SOC)**
This study is **not an alternative** to her planned frontline therapy (Carboplatin + Paclitaxel + Bevacizumab). It is an observational study that would run in parallel with SOC. It offers no treatment to compare. Her planned regimen is the appropriate, evidence-based standard for her diagnosis and clinical presentation.

**5. Critical Considerations**
The most critical consideration is that this trial is not a treatment option. It will not alter Ayesha's clinical course or provide a therapeutic alternative. The definitive barrier is the lack of a local site.

**Recommendation:** This trial is not a viable or relevant option for Ayesha. The focus should remain on initiating her planned standard-of-care chemotherapy with Carboplatin, Paclitaxel, and Bevacizumab without delay.

💡 STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS

### Best-Case Scenario:
✅ Ayesha enrolls in NCT06331130
✅ Access to experimental therapy
✅ Close monitoring, expert care
**Probability**: ~50%

### Most Likely Scenario:
Ayesha completes screening and enrolls successfully

### Challenge Scenario:

## 📋 FULL ELIGIBILITY TEXT

### Eligibility Criteria
Inclusion Criteria:

1. Women with confirmed HGSOC wiht mesenteric involvment
2. Age \> 18 years
3. FIGO STAGE IIIB-IV
4. Primary diagnosis
5. Signed informed consent

Exclusion Criteria:

1. Non-serous high grade epithelial ovarian cancer (serous low grade, mucinous, clear cell carcinoma, endometrioid or non-epithelial ovarian cancer)
2. Early stage disease (I and II stage)
3. CT scan not available
4. Non-primary diagnosis or patient subjected to neoadjuvant chemotherapy

---

## 📊 TRIAL DESCRIPTION

To evaluate if CT features at diagnosis in patients with HGSOC can be used to build an Artificial Intelligence model capable of discerning the pathological involvement of the mesentery, assessing the potential impediments for an optimal debulking surgery and predicting the development of resistance to platinum based chemotherapeutic agents.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL GATES FOR AYESHA

✅ No critical biomarker gates identified. Proceed with standard eligibility screening.

## ⚔️ TACTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS

**Priority**: 🔥 **P0 - IMMEDIATE ACTION** (Eligibility: ~50%)

**Next Steps**:
1. **Order biomarker tests** (HER2 IHC, HRD if not done)
2. **Contact trial site** (within 48 hours)
3. **Pre-screen Ayesha** (get on coordinator's radar)
4. **Decision at Week 2**: Enroll if eligible
5. **Prepare medical records** (surgical report, pathology, CA-125 history)

**Expected Timeline**:
- Week 1: Complete L1 chemo (cycle 6)
- Week 2: Biomarker results available
- Week 3: Enroll in trial (if eligible) or proceed with SOC maintenance


---

## 🎯 VALUE PROPOSITION

**WIN-WIN SCENARIO**:
- If eligible (50% chance) → Access to experimental therapy
- If not eligible → Gets proven SOC (PARP or bevacizumab maintenance)
- Either way, Ayesha receives appropriate care

**Risk-Benefit**: Low risk (pre-screening doesn't commit to enrollment), high reward (cutting-edge therapy)
