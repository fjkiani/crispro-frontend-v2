WHY RESISTANCE PROPHET FAILED (AUROC 0.464):
  
  ROOT CAUSE:
    Tried to predict ADAPTIVE resistance (Layer 2)
    Using only BASELINE genetics (Layer 1)
    
  METAPHOR:
    Like predicting when a fire will spread (adaptive)
    Using only what materials exist at start (baseline)
    Cannot see wind changes, new fuel sources (kinetics)

  RESULT:
    Sensitivity = 0.000 (never predicts resistant)
    Specificity = 1.000 (always predicts sensitive)
    Model too conservative (baseline signals too weak)

THE FIX:
  Add Layer 2 signals (CA-125 kinetics)
  Genetics = "What can go wrong" (baseline risk)
  Kinetics = "What IS going wrong" (adaptive signal)
  Combined = Earlier detection than either alone
```

## **S1 → PLCO CONNECTION**

### **Why PLCO Matters (From S1 Perspective):**

S1 IDENTIFIED: Serial CA-125 is Priority 1 (highest leverage)

PLCO PROVIDES:
  ✅ Serial CA-125 (up to 5 annual measurements)
  ✅ Timestamps (days from randomization)
  ✅ Cancer outcomes (72 incident cancers)
  ✅ Large cohort (78,000 women)

BUT:
  ⚠️ Screening cohort (healthy → cancer onset)
  ⚠️ NOT treatment cohort (diagnosed → resistance)
  ⚠️ Different biological question

WHAT PLCO PROVES:
  ✅ CA-125 kinetics work for ONSET detection (Layer 2 signal validated)
  ✅ Infrastructure works (harness, KELIM computation)
  ✅ Stepping stone to treatment cohorts

WHAT PLCO DOESN'T PROVE:
  ❌ MAPK + CA-125 for RESISTANCE detection (wrong cohort)
  ❌ Adaptive resistance timing (no treatment context)
  ❌ Clinical utility for Resistance Prophet (different endpoint)

VERDICT:
  PLCO = Proof-of-kinetics (valuable, but not final validation)
  Treatment cohort = TRUE validation (S4 must find this)
```
