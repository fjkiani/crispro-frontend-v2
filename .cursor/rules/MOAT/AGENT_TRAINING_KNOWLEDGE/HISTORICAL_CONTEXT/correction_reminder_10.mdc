## **PART 5: HONEST RECOMMENDATION**

### **What to Do With Scanpy (PHASED APPROACH)**

```yaml
IMMEDIATE (Weeks 1-16): DO NOT BUILD SCANPY INTEGRATION
  Why: Data doesn't exist yet (need treatment cohort from S4)
  Focus: Phase 1A (baseline genetics) + Phase 1B (KELIM if PLCO approved)
  
  Scanpy Action: ADD TO GRAVEYARD INTELLIGENCE DATABASE
    - Document as validated-but-buried biomarker
    - Evidence: 88/100
    - Burial: 72/100 (research-clinical gap)
    - Actionability: 91/100
    - Graveyard Value: 84.1 (TOP TIER)

PHASE 1C (Weeks 17-24, IF S4 ACQUIRES DATA):
  Prerequisite: Treatment cohort with scRNA-seq + serial CA-125
  
  Task: Scanpy Proof-of-Concept (4 weeks, NOT 72 hours)
    Week 1-2: Data acquisition + preprocessing
      - Download treatment cohort scRNA-seq
      - QC, normalization, batch correction
      - Preflight Gate: Data quality validation
    
    Week 3: Clustering + annotation
      - Leiden clustering (tune resolution)
      - Cell type annotation (immune, malignant)
      - Validate: Annotation accuracy vs literature
    
    Week 4: Signature extraction + integration
      - Extract resistant cell signatures
      - Project to bulk RNA-seq (TCGA-OV validation)
      - Integrate with MAPK + KELIM
      - Validate: 3-signal model AUROC

PHASE 2 (Weeks 25-36, IF PHASE 1C SUCCEEDS):
  Task: Production Scanpy Pipeline (12 weeks)
    Week 25-28: Pipeline development
      - Standardized QC workflow
      - Automated cell type annotation
      - Signature extraction module
    
    Week 29-32: Integration with Resistance Prophet
      - Add scRNA-seq resistance score to API
      - Multi-modal scoring (MAPK + KELIM + scRNA-seq)
      - Validation on holdout cohort
    
    Week 33-36: Clinical deployment prep
      - Cost-benefit analysis (is $1000/sample worth it?)
      - Reimbursement strategy (how to get insurance coverage?)
      - Protocol standardization (FDA qualification path)

REALISTIC TIMELINE TO PRODUCTION:
  Best case: 36 weeks (9 months)
  Likely case: 52+ weeks (12+ months)
  Blocking: S4 data acquisition (treatment cohort)
