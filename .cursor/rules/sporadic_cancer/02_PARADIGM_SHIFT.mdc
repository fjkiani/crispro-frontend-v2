# 🎯 PARADIGM SHIFT - GERMLINE → TUMOR

---

## **WHAT CHANGES WHEN GERMLINE NEGATIVE**

| Germline-Centric | Tumor-Centric (Sporadic) |
|---|---|
| Family history screening | Tumor NGS panel |
| Inherited mutation counseling | Somatic mutation profiling |
| Predictable pathway disruption | Complex multi-hit evolution |
| PARP inhibitors (BRCA) | Pathway-agnostic therapies |
| Preventive surgery for family | Tumor-based trial matching |

## **WHAT WE NEED**

### **1. Tumor-Only NGS**:
- Somatic mutations (TP53, KRAS, PIK3CA)
- Copy number alterations (amplifications/deletions)
- TMB (tumor mutational burden)
- MSI (microsatellite instability)
- HRD score (somatic, not germline)

### **2. Treatment History**:
- Line 1, 2, 3+ with regimens
- Response duration (PFS)
- Toxicity/tolerability

### **3. Imaging Context**:
- Stage (I-IV)
- Metastatic sites
- Disease burden

## **PLATFORM SHIFT**

**From**: Germline variant analysis  
**To**: Tumor somatic variant + TMB/MSI/HRD + treatment lines

**Impact**: Complete re-architecture of S/P/E scoring
