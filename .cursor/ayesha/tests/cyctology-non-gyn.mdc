  NON-GYN CYTOLOGY
 1400 cc of bloody fluid received. 1 ThinPrep slide, 1 cell block and 1 Diff Quik-stained smear prepared.
CLINICAL HISTORY:
Post-menopausal bleeding
DIAGNOSIS(ES):
SPECIMEN ADEQUACY:
SATISFACTORY FOR EVALUATION
INTERPRETATION:
POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS
Metastatic adenocarcinoma, consistent with Mullerian primary (see note).
Note: The specimen consists of clusters of markedly atypical epithelial cells with vacuolated cytoplasm and prominent nucleoli. Immunohistochemical stains performed with adequate controls show the tumor cells to be positive for claudin4, MOC31, CK7, PAX8 and WT1, and negative for calretinin, CD163, TTF1, GATA3 and CK20. The tumor cells show strong and diffuse expression of p16 and p53, consistent with mutant type staining. ER is weakly to moderately positive in about 60% of tumor cells, while PR is negative (0%). The overall findings are consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma of Mullerian primary.
Smear, ThinPrep slide, and cell block section were evaluated. Please refer to concurrent specimen reports (GP25-3371, CN25-5778 and CN25-5773) for complete evaluation and ancillary studies.

Slides may have been examined as digital images including consultation for intraoperative frozen sections. Hardware and software for digital images have been developed by Leica Biosystems, PathAI, and NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital (NYPH). Their performance characteristics have been determined by the NYPH/CUMC Department of Pathology and validated as a laboratory developed test. This test is used for clinical purposes. Pursuant to the requirements of CLIA '88, our laboratory has established the equivalent and non-inferiority for this test for reporting of pathology. It has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The New York State Department of Health has not evaluated any test claims nor reviewed the accuracy of this test.
Note: Immunochemistry testing performed at CUIMC was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the Pathology Department, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY. These tests were interpreted in conjunction with external positive and internal negative controls, unless otherwise noted. It has not been cleared or approved by the US FDA. This test is used for clinical purposes only. It should not be regarded as investigational or for research.
