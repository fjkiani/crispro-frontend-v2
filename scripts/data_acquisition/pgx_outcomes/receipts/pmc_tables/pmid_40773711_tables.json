Abbreviations: DGI, drug-gene interaction; ECOG, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group; FOLFIRI, FU, leucovorin, and irinotecan; FOLFOX, infusional FU, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin; FP, fluoropyrimidine; FU, fluorouracil; IM, intermediate metabolizer; NM, normal metabolizer; PMs, poor metabolizers; SD, standard deviation. a DGI group is defined as patients with a drug-gene interaction that requires dose adjustment or change in therapy. This includes DPYD variant carriers on fluoropyrimidine therapy, or UGT1A1 PMs on irinotecan therapy. b Non-DGI group is defined as patients without a drug-gene interaction and can receive standard dose. This includes DPYD NMs on fluoropyrimidine therapy, UGT1A1 NMs or IMs on irinotecan therapy, or UGT1A1 PMs only receiving fluoropyrimidine therapy. c Other cancers in the prospective cohort are adenocarcinoma of unknown GI origin (n = 1), ampullary (n = 2), anal (n = 9), appendiceal (n = 11), cholangiocarcinoma (n = 3), esophageal (n = 10), gastric (n = 8), and small intestine (n = 8). Other cancers in the biobank cohort are appendiceal (n = 2), esophageal (n = 8), gastric (n = 8), hepatic (n = 1), iliac (n = 1), peritoneal (n = 1), and small intestine (n = 1). d Other treatment regimens in the prospective cohort include FLOT (n = 4) FU and mitomycin with or without radiation (n = 3), FU with liposomal irinotecan (n = 1), FU monotherapy (n = 1), and irinotecan only (n = 1). Other treatment regimens in the biobank cohort include FU monotherapy with or without radiation (n = 9), FU with bevacizumab (n = 1), FU and mitomycin with or without radiation (n = 4), FU with liposomal irinotecan (n = 3), and irinotecan only (n = 2) e One individual was both a DPYD IM and a UGT1A1 PM, but only received treatment with a FP. This is why there are 9 UGT1A1 PMs noted here, but only eight reported as actionable (Table 3 )."
