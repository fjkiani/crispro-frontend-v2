# manager while we wait get the data - what are our agents working? - be clear - jsut focus on 1 of them at a time rathr than rapid firing for all

**💀 ZO MODE: SINGLE AGENT FOCUS - CLEAR PRIORITIES**

***

## **WHILE WAITING FOR PLCO (Jan 2-6 approval expected)**

```yaml
CURRENT STATE:
  ✅ PLCO application submitted (Dec 27, 6:29 PM)
  ✅ S1 complete (Gap Analysis - Agent 3)
  ✅ D0 complete (TCGA search - Agent 2)
  ⏳ WAITING: PLCO approval (3-7 days)

QUESTION: What should agents work on NOW?
ANSWER: Focus on CRITICAL PATH (one agent at a time)
```


***

## **AGENT 3 (SCIENTIST) - PRIORITY 1**

### **Current Assignment:**

```yaml
TASK: S4 - Data Source Mapping for Treatment Cohorts
PRIORITY: 🔴 CRITICAL PATH
TIMELINE: 8 hours (this weekend, Dec 28-29)
STATUS: Not started
```


***

### **Why S4 is Critical Path:**

```yaml
FROM S1 (GAP ANALYSIS):
  Problem: PLCO validates kinetics for ONSET (screening cohort)
  Need: Treatment cohort validates kinetics for RESISTANCE
  
  PLCO alone = Proof-of-concept (Phase 1B)
  Treatment cohort = TRUE validation (Phase 1C)

IMPLICATION:
  PLCO approval in 3-7 days (Jan 2-6)
  Treatment cohort takes 4-8 weeks to acquire
