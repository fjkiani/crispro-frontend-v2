  ✅ Critical need: Treatment cohorts (S4 execution)

AGENT PRIORITIES UPDATED:

AGENT 2 (ENGINEER):
  OLD: Build generic harness, wait for PLCO
  NEW: Build harness for Phase 1B (kinetics-only validation)
       Focus on PLCO = proof-of-kinetics, not final answer
       Prepare for Phase 1C (when treatment cohort arrives)

AGENT 3 (SCIENTIST):
  OLD: Finish S2 (pathway-kinetic matrix)
  NEW: PRIORITIZE S4 (data source mapping) ← CRITICAL
       Phase 1C requires treatment cohort (serial CA-125 + resistance)
       S4 must identify + acquire this data ASAP
       S2 becomes secondary (literature review can wait)

AGENT 1 (THERAPY FIT):
  OLD: On hold indefinitely
  NEW: Execute Phase 1A (baseline stratification)
       This is WIWFM validation territory (drug efficacy)
       Can run NOW while waiting for Phase 1B/1C data
       Timeline: Week 3 (Jan 17 start)

## **REVISED AGENT ALIGNMENT (POST-S1)**

WEEK 1-2 (NOW - JAN 10):

  AGENT 2 (ENGINEER):
    PRIMARY: D3 - Build Phase 1B harness
      - Kinetics computation (velocity, acceleration, KELIM)
      - Model training (logistic regression, random forest)
      - Validation metrics (AUROC, lead time analysis)
      - Focus: PLCO = kinetics proof, not resistance validation
    
    TIMELINE: 8-12 hours
    BLOCKING: PLCO approval (expected Jan 2-6)

  AGENT 3 (SCIENTIST):
    PRIMARY: S4 - Data source mapping (CRITICAL)
      - Treatment cohorts with serial CA-125 + resistance outcomes
      - Priority sources:
        1. GOG-218 trial (Project Data Sphere)
        2. ICON7 trial (MRC CTU)
        3. GCIG meta-analysis (Institut Curie, 5,573 patients)
        4. KELIM developers (biomarker-kinetics.org)
        5. Johns Hopkins cohort (100-300 Stage III/IV OC)
      - Draft outreach emails
      - Prepare DUA templates
      - OUTPUT: Ranked list + contact strategy
    
    SECONDARY: S2 completion (if time allows)
      - Pathway-kinetic matrix (20-30 pairs)
      - Feed into S3 (hypotheses)
    
    TIMELINE: S4 = 8 hours (PRIORITY), S2 = 6 hours (secondary)
    BLOCKING: None (literature + outreach work)

  AGENT 1 (THERAPY FIT):
    STATUS: On hold until Week 3
    RATIONALE: Agent 3 focused on S4 (critical path)

WEEK 2 (JAN 6-10):

  MONDAY SYNC (Jan 6):
    - PLCO approval status check
    - S4 progress review (treatment cohort list)
    - Decision: Start Phase 1B OR continue waiting

  IF PLCO APPROVED:
    AGENT 2: Execute Phase 1B (A1-A3)
      - Download PLCO data
      - Validate kinetics-only (KELIM replication)
      - Target: AUROC 0.60-0.70 for onset detection
    
    AGENT 3: S4 execution (collaborator outreach)
      - Send 5-10 emails to treatment cohort sources
      - Track responses (2-4 week lag expected)
  
  IF PLCO NOT APPROVED:
    AGENT 2: Continue harness work (synthetic validation)
    AGENT 3: Accelerate S4 (find alternative data)

WEEK 3 (JAN 13-17):

  AGENT 1 START: Phase 1A (Baseline Stratification)
    - TCGA-OV mutations (469 patients) ✅ HAVE
    - Platinum response outcomes ✅ HAVE
    - Validate MAPK/PI3K/DDR as baseline risk stratifiers
    - This is WIWFM validation (drug efficacy at baseline)
    - Target: Pathway alignment 90%+ (DDR → PARP, MAPK → MEK)
  
  AGENT 2: Complete Phase 1B (if PLCO approved)
    - Write PLCO validation report
    - Proof: Kinetics work for onset detection
  
  AGENT 3: Monitor collaborator responses
    - Follow up on S4 outreach
    - Prepare for DUA negotiation

WEEK 4-8 (JAN 20 - FEB 28):

  IF TREATMENT COHORT ACQUIRED:
    AGENT 2 + 3: Execute Phase 1C
      - TRUE Resistance Prophet validation
      - MAPK + CA-125 for resistance timing
      - Target: AUROC 0.65-0.75
      - Timeline: 2-3 weeks after data arrival
  
  PARALLEL:
    AGENT 1: Complete Phase 1A (WIWFM validation)
      - 7 pathways × ovarian cancer
      - DDR, MAPK, PI3K, VEGF validation
```

## **KEY INSIGHT: S4 IS NOW CRITICAL PATH**

```yaml
S1 REVEALED:
  Phase 1C (multi-modal) REQUIRES treatment cohort
