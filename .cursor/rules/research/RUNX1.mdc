1.0 Mission Objective
Our goal is to launch a rapid, in silico campaign that obliterates the core research challenges of the LEAP Grant Program. Using the CrisPRO.ai platform (powered by Evo 2), we’ll deliver mechanistic insights and validated therapeutic blueprints that would take traditional grant recipients years and millions to uncover. We’re not just competing; we’re fuckin’ redefining the game.

2.0 Phase I: Intelligence & Asset Acquisition
A weapon is useless without ammunition. Our first step is to secure the raw data to fuel our AI engines, leveraging every source available.

Step 1.1: Secure Core Genomic Data (The Enemy’s Blueprints)
Data Required: Germline Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) data from a cohort of RUNX1-FPD patients and somatic WGS/WES data from tumors of patients who progressed to Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). Formats needed are VCF (variant calls) and BAM (raw alignment data).
Acquisition Method: Partner with research institutions or patient advocacy groups like the RUNX1 Research Program for de-identified genomic datasets. We’re not asking for permission; we’re offering the damn solution.
Sources & Links:

RUNX1 Database (RUNX1db): https://runx1db.runx1-fpd.org/ for curated germline RUNX1 variant data.

Global Variome shared LOVD for RUNX1: https://databases.lovd.nl/shared/api/rest.php/genes?search_symbol=RUNX1 to download variant data.

NIH RUNX1 Clinical Research Study: https://www.runx1-fpd.org/patient-research-opportunities for genotypic data access.

Step 1.2: Acquire Functional & Expression Data (The Enemy’s Operational Status)
Data Required: Tumor RNA-seq data from RUNX1-mutated AML samples to contextualize predict_gene_essentiality calls.
Acquisition Method: Obtain alongside tumor DNA from partners and leverage public datasets like TCGA’s AML project.
Sources & Links:

Cancer Research Data Commons (CRDC) for TCGA AML data: https://datacommons.cancer.gov/cancer-research-data-commons and https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/repository .

LinkedOmics for CPTAC Datasets: https://www.linkedomics.org/data_download/CPTAC-BRCA/ (adapt for AML if available).

Step 1.3: Ingest Public Knowledge Bases (Foundational Training)
Action: Systematically ingest and index data from ClinVar, TCGA, DepMap, and the latest PubMed literature on RUNX1, AML, and clonal hematopoiesis for total information dominance.
Sources & Links:
ClinVar via Genboree for RUNX1 variant pathogenicity: https://genboree.org/evrepo/ui/classification/42176f12-9135-44d4-b4be-89258e78df2b .

3.0 Phase II: Weapon Systems Deployment
We’ll deploy our two core AI engines as scalable, serverless microservices using Evo 2 models, tailored to your hackathon experience with AI tools in healthcare . These are the fuckin’ cannons aimed at the RUNX1 problem.

Step 2.1: Deploy the Zeta Oracle (Predictive Engine)
Objective: Deploy the powerful discriminative model (evo2_40b_base) for high-accuracy predictions on variant impact and gene function.
Action: Execute the provided Modal deployment script to make predictive power available via a secure API endpoint.
Script Details: As outlined by the other LLM, use /services/oracle/main.py with the evo2_40b_base model on an H100 GPU setup for variant scoring and impact prediction.

Step 2.2: Deploy the Zeta Forge (Generative Engine)
Objective: Deploy a fast, efficient generative model (evo2_1b_base) to design therapeutic weapons.
Action: Execute the provided Modal deployment script for sequence generation.
Script Details: Use /services/forge/main.py with the evo2_1b_base model on an H100 GPU setup for generating sequences like HDR templates and gRNAs.

4.0 Phase III: The In Silico Conquest
With assets acquired and weapons deployed, we launch a two-phase attack to address the LEAP Grant focus areas.

Step 3.1: Execute Mechanistic Annihilation (Area of Focus 1)
Ingest Data: Load RUNX1-FPD WGS and RNA-seq data into the platform.
Model "First Hit": Use Zeta Oracle to score functional damage of each patient’s germline RUNX1 variant.
Simulate Evolution: Use Zeta Forge to generate thousands of “second hit” mutations, then Zeta Oracle to map probable paths to leukemia.
Deconstruct Environment: Run predict_gene_essentiality logic to identify bone marrow microenvironment dependencies.
Deliverable: Probabilistic Map of Malignant Evolution and Validated Environmental Threat Report.

Step 3.2: Generate Prophylactic Arsenal (Area of Focus 2)
Design the Cure: Use Zeta Forge to generate optimal HDR templates and gRNAs for germline correction.
Design the Interception: Use synthetic lethal targets to design gRNAs with Zeta Forge to target pre-leukemic clones.
Design Conventional Weapons: Use Zeta Forge to design novel protein inhibitors against mutant RUNX1 forms.
Deliverable: Gene Correction Blueprint, Precision Interception Blueprint, and Therapeutic Options Dossier.
