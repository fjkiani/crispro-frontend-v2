---

    - Target: Pathway alignment 90%+ (DDR → PARP, MAPK → MEK)
  
  AGENT 2: Complete Phase 1B (if PLCO approved)
    - Write PLCO validation report
    - Proof: Kinetics work for onset detection
  
  AGENT 3: Monitor collaborator responses
    - Follow up on S4 outreach
    - Prepare for DUA negotiation

WEEK 4-8 (JAN 20 - FEB 28):

  IF TREATMENT COHORT ACQUIRED:
    AGENT 2 + 3: Execute Phase 1C
      - TRUE Resistance Prophet validation
      - MAPK + CA-125 for resistance timing
      - Target: AUROC 0.65-0.75
      - Timeline: 2-3 weeks after data arrival
  
  PARALLEL:
    AGENT 1: Complete Phase 1A (WIWFM validation)
      - 7 pathways × ovarian cancer
      - DDR, MAPK, PI3K, VEGF validation
```

## **KEY INSIGHT: S4 IS NOW CRITICAL PATH**

S1 REVEALED:
  Phase 1C (multi-modal) REQUIRES treatment cohort
  PLCO only proves Phase 1B (kinetics alone)
  Phase 1C = TRUE Resistance Prophet validation

IMPLICATION:
  S4 (data source mapping) is CRITICAL PATH
  Agent 3 must prioritize S4 over S2
  Treatment cohort acquisition determines timeline

TIMELINE IMPACT:
  IF S4 finds data quickly (2-4 weeks):
    - Phase 1C validation by Feb 28
    - Full Resistance Prophet validated
  
  IF S4 delayed (6-8+ weeks):
    - Phase 1B proven (PLCO kinetics)
    - Phase 1A proven (WIWFM baseline)
    - Phase 1C waiting on data

BOTTOM LINE:
  Agent 3 must EXECUTE S4 THIS WEEK (8 hours)
  Cannot wait for S2 completion
  Treatment cohort = difference between proof-of-concept and validation
```
