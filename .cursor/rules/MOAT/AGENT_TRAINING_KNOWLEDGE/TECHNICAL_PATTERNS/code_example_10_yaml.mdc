# Code Example 10 (yaml)

**Category**: pattern
**Priority**: P2
**Source**: Chat log lines 360-419

---

  Mitigation: Agent 3 accelerates S4 (external data sources)
  Backup: Project Data Sphere, Vivli, YODA platforms
  Timeline impact: +2-4 weeks

RISK 2: PLCO kinetics fail (AUROC <0.60)
  Mitigation: Honest assessment, learn from failure
  Pivot: Focus on WIWFM (proven), await treatment cohort
  Timeline impact: None (WIWFM ready to execute)

RISK 3: Treatment cohort access denied
  Mitigation: Multiple collaborators contacted (5-10)
  Backup: Synthetic CA-125 for proof-of-concept only
  Timeline impact: +4-8 weeks (try alternative sources)

RISK 4: Agent bandwidth constraints (2 parallel tracks)
  Mitigation: Sequential execution (WIWFM in Week 3)
  Prioritization: RP infrastructure first, WIWFM second
  Timeline impact: +2-3 weeks (sequential not parallel)

RISK 5: Holiday delays (New Year's week)
  Mitigation: Expect Jan 2-6 for approvals
  Use wait time: Build harness, execute S4
  Timeline impact: Already accounted for

## **SUCCESS METRICS**

WEEK 2 (Jan 10):
  ✅ PLCO approval received
  ✅ S4 complete (treatment cohort list + contact strategy)
  ✅ Validation harness ready (D3 complete)

WEEK 3 (Jan 17):
  ✅ PLCO kinetics validated (AUROC 0.65-0.75)
  ✅ Collaborator outreach sent (5-10 emails)
  ✅ WIWFM validation started (Agent 1)

WEEK 4-6 (Jan 24 - Feb 7):
  ✅ PLCO report written (kinetics proof-of-concept)
  ✅ WIWFM validation complete (pathway alignment ≥90%)
  ✅ Treatment cohort DUA negotiated (if responses received)

WEEK 8 (Feb 28):
  ✅ Two validation reports complete (PLCO + WIWFM)
  ✅ Treatment cohort data acquired OR in progress
  ✅ Resistance Prophet ready to validate (when data arrives)
