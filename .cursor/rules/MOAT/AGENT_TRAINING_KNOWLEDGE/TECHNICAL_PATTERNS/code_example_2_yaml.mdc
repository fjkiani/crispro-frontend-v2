---

AGENT 1 (PREVIOUS - THERAPY FIT VALIDATOR):
  Deliverable: ✅ Comprehensive Therapy Fit validation plan
  Status: COMPLETE (7 pathways × 10+ cancers strategy)
  Mission: Validate WIWFM (drug efficacy predictions)
  Timeline: Ready to execute Week 3-4
  Owner: Can be Agent 3 or separate agent

AGENT 2 (ENGINEER - RESISTANCE PROPHET INFRASTRUCTURE):
  D0: ✅ COMPLETE (TCGA lacks CA-125, PLCO identified)
  D1: ✅ COMPLETE (PLCO application submitted)
  D2: ⏸️ PENDING (Proof-of-path for multi-modal logic)
  D3: ⏸️ PENDING (Validation harness)
  D4: ✅ COMPLETE (Validation protocol already exists)
  Status: Waiting on PLCO approval
  Mission: Build kinetics validation infrastructure

AGENT 3 (SCIENTIST - VALIDATION ROADMAP):
  S1: ✅ COMPLETE (Gap analysis - excellent work)
  S2: ⏳ IN PROGRESS (Pathway-kinetic matrix, 6 hours)
  S3: ⏸️ PENDING (Priority hypotheses, depends on S2)
  S4: ⏸️ PENDING (Data source mapping - CRITICAL)
  Status: Executing S2, needs to pivot to S4
  Mission: Map validation landscape, find treatment cohorts

## **THE ALIGNMENT PROBLEM**

TWO DIFFERENT PRODUCTS:
  1. WIWFM (Therapy Fit): Drug efficacy at baseline
  2. Resistance Prophet: Early resistance detection (baseline + kinetics)

SHARED FOUNDATION:
  ✅ 7 pathways framework (DDR, MAPK, PI3K, VEGF, HER2, IO, Efflux)
  ✅ TCGA-OV dataset (469 patients, baseline mutations)
  ✅ Ovarian cancer focus (initial validation)

DIFFERENT VALIDATION NEEDS:
  WIWFM:
    - Baseline mutations → Drug rankings
    - Endpoint: Treatment response (sensitive vs resistant)
    - Data: TCGA-OV mutations + platinum response ✅ HAVE
    - Timeline: Can execute now (Week 3-4)
  
  Resistance Prophet:
    - Baseline + kinetics → Resistance timing
    - Endpoint: Time to resistance (weeks 6-18)
    - Data: Serial CA-125 + mutations ❌ DON'T HAVE (yet)
    - Timeline: 3-7 weeks (waiting on PLCO or collaborators)

ALIGNMENT QUESTION:
  Do we execute sequentially (RP first, then WIWFM)?
  Or parallel (both at once)?
  Or opportunistic (WIWFM now, RP when data arrives)?
```

## **RECOMMENDED ALIGNMENT: HYBRID PARALLEL**
