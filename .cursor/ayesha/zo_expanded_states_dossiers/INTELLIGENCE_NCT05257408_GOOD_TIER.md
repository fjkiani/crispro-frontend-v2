## 🎯 WHY THIS TRIAL IS A GOOD FIT FOR AYESHA (LLM Analysis)

### **Clinical Trial Analysis: NCT05257408**

**Note**: This is a structured fallback analysis (LLM unavailable).

#### **1. Drug Mechanism Fit**
The trial "Relacorilant in Combination With Nab-Paclitaxel in Advanced, Platinum-Resistant, High-Grade Epithelial Ovarian, Primary Peritoneal, or Fallopian-Tube Cancer" requires detailed mechanism analysis. Review the trial protocol to understand how the investigational drug addresses Ayesha's Stage IVB High-Grade Serous Ovarian Carcinoma with extensive tumor burden and pleural metastases.

#### **2. Location Logistics**
Review trial locations to identify NYC metro sites accessible from ZIP 10029 (East Harlem). Preferred centers: Mount Sinai (local), MSK (2 miles), NYU Langone (3-4 miles).

#### **3. Risk-Benefit for Ayesha**
**Key Considerations**:
- Pulmonary compromise: Large bilateral pleural effusions require careful monitoring
- ECOG 1: Acceptable for most trials, but toxicity profile is critical
- Tumor burden: Extensive disease (CA-125 >2800) may require aggressive initial treatment

#### **4. Comparison to Standard of Care**
Ayesha's planned SOC is Carboplatin + Paclitaxel + Bevacizumab (NCCN-guideline first-line therapy for Stage IVB HGSOC, BRCA wildtype). This trial should be compared to this regimen to assess:
- Is it a replacement for SOC (frontline trial)?
- Is it additional to SOC (maintenance trial)?
- Is it an alternative if SOC fails?

#### **5. Critical Considerations**
1. **Biomarker testing**: HER2 and HRD status are unknown - may be required for enrollment
2. **Timing**: When should Ayesha enroll? Before SOC, during SOC, or after response?
3. **Clinical team review**: Discuss with Ayesha's oncologist before enrollment decisions

**Recommendation**: Full protocol review with clinical team required.

## 📊 TRIAL DESCRIPTION

The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate progression-free survival (PFS) by blinded independent central review (BICR) and overall survival (OS) (evaluated independently, as dual primary endpoints) in patients treated with intermittent regimen of Relacorilant in combination with nab-paclitaxel compared with patients treated with nab-paclitaxel monotherapy.
