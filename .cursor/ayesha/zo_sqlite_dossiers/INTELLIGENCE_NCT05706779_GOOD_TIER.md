## 🎯 WHY THIS TRIAL IS A GOOD FIT FOR AYESHA (LLM Analysis)

### **Clinical Trial Analysis: NCT05706779**

**Note**: This is a structured fallback analysis (LLM unavailable).

#### **1. Drug Mechanism Fit**
The trial "Encorafenib Plus Cetuximab in a Neoadjuvant Setting in Patients With BRAF Mutation Localised Colon or Upper Rectum Cancer" requires detailed mechanism analysis. Review the trial protocol to understand how the investigational drug addresses Ayesha's Stage IVB High-Grade Serous Ovarian Carcinoma with extensive tumor burden and pleural metastases.

#### **2. Location Logistics**
Review trial locations to identify NYC metro sites accessible from ZIP 10029 (East Harlem). Preferred centers: Mount Sinai (local), MSK (2 miles), NYU Langone (3-4 miles).

#### **3. Risk-Benefit for Ayesha**
**Key Considerations**:
- Pulmonary compromise: Large bilateral pleural effusions require careful monitoring
- ECOG 1: Acceptable for most trials, but toxicity profile is critical
- Tumor burden: Extensive disease (CA-125 >2800) may require aggressive initial treatment

#### **4. Comparison to Standard of Care**
Ayesha's planned SOC is Carboplatin + Paclitaxel + Bevacizumab (NCCN-guideline first-line therapy for Stage IVB HGSOC, BRCA wildtype). This trial should be compared to this regimen to assess:
- Is it a replacement for SOC (frontline trial)?
- Is it additional to SOC (maintenance trial)?
- Is it an alternative if SOC fails?

#### **5. Critical Considerations**
1. **Biomarker testing**: HER2 and HRD status are unknown - may be required for enrollment
2. **Timing**: When should Ayesha enroll? Before SOC, during SOC, or after response?
3. **Clinical team review**: Discuss with Ayesha's oncologist before enrollment decisions

**Recommendation**: Full protocol review with clinical team required.

## 📊 TRIAL DESCRIPTION

This is a pilot trial which aims to assess the concept of anti-BRAF neoadjuvant treatment (encorafenib) in combination with cetuximab in patients with colon cancer or rT3/T4 supra-peritoneal upper rectal cancer based on a pre-operative CT-scan. About 10% of patients will have a mutated BRAF V600E tumour and the objective is to include 30 patients with this mutation.

If the tumour is not confirmed as a carrier of the BRAF V600E mutation or has an RAS mutation according to centralised assessment, treatment will be discontinued in this patient and cancer surgery will be organised as soon as possible. The patient will be excluded from the statistical analysis and will be replaced by a new patient in order to obtain 30 patients with confirmed BRAF V600E mutation and RAS wild type . It should be noted that less than a 3% discrepancy between the numbers of local laboratory results and central analysis results, has been reported in over 600 BRAF V600E mutated colon cancers in the BEACON CRC study. Based on these figures, there should be 0 or 1 patient with discrepant results in the study presented here.

Furthermore, in the hypothetical case of a patient who is an early permanent discontinuation of the study prior to surgery, this patient will be replaced in order to obtain a total of 30 patients who underwent surgery after neoadjuvant treatment.

## ⚔️ TACTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS

**Priority**: ⚠️ **P1 - HIGH PRIORITY** (Eligibility: ~100%)

**Next Steps**:
1. **Review eligibility carefully** (with oncologist)
2. **Order pending biomarker tests** (if required)
3. **Contact trial site** (within 1 week)
4. **Backup option** (if top-tier trials fail)


---

## 🎯 VALUE PROPOSITION

**WIN-WIN SCENARIO**:
- If eligible (100% chance) → Access to experimental therapy
- If not eligible → Gets proven SOC (PARP or bevacizumab maintenance)
- Either way, Ayesha receives appropriate care

**Risk-Benefit**: Low risk (pre-screening doesn't commit to enrollment), high reward (cutting-edge therapy)
