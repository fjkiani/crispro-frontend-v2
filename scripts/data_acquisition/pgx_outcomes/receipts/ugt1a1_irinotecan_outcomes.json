      "title": "Clinical Benefits and Utility of Pretherapeutic DPYD and UGT1A1 Testing in Gastrointestinal Cancer: A Secondary Analysis of the PREPARE Randomized Clinical Trial.",
      "abstract": "To date, the clinical benefit and utility of implementing a DPYD/UGT1A1 pharmacogenetic-informed therapy with fluoropyrimidines and/or irinotecan have not been prospectively investigated. To examine clinically relevant toxic effects, hospitalizations, and related costs while preserving treatment intensity and efficacy outcomes in patients with gastrointestinal cancer. This nonprespecified secondary analysis stems from Pre-Emptive Pharmacogenomic Testing for Preventing Adverse Drug Reactions (PREPARE), a multicenter, controlled, open, block-randomized, crossover implementation trial conducted from March 7, 2017, to June 30, 2020, and includes data from Italy according to a sequential study design. The study population included 563 patients (intervention, 252; control [standard of care], 311) with gastrointestinal cancer (age &#x2265;18 years) who were eligible for fluoropyrimidine and/or irinotecan treatment. Data analysis for the present study was performed from May 27 to October 10, 2024. Participants with actionable variants (DPYD*2A, DPYD*13, .DPYD c.2846A&gt;T, and DPYD c.1236G&gt;A for fluoropyrimidines, and UGT1A1*28, UGT1A1*6, and UGT1A1*27 for irinotecan) received drug or dose adjustments based on Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group recommendations. The primary outcome was clinically relevant toxic effects (National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade &#x2265;4 hematologic, grade &#x2265;3 nonhematologic, or causing hospitalization, fluoropyrimidines and/or irinotecan causally related). Secondary outcomes included hospitalization rates, toxic effect management costs, intensity of treatment, quality-adjusted life-years, and 3-year overall survival. Overall, 1232 patients were enrolled in Italy, with 563 included in this analysis (317 [56.3%] men; median age, 68.0 [IQR, 60.0-75.0] years). In the intervention arm, carriers of any actionable genotype exhibited a 90% lower risk of clinically relevant toxic effects compared with the control arm (odds ratio, 0.1; 95% CI, 0.0-0.8; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.04). They also presented higher toxic effect management costs per patient ($4159; 95% CI, $1510-$6810) compared with patients in the intervention arm ($26; 95% CI, 0-$312) (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.004) and a higher rate of hospitalization (34.8% vs 11.8%; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.12). The differences were not significant among all patients. Three-year overall survival did not differ significantly between arms, while quality-adjusted life-years significantly improved in the intervention arm. The pharmacogenetics-informed approach did not manifest a detrimental effect on treatment intensity in actionable genotype carriers. In this secondary analysis of PREPARE, pretreatment application of DPYD- and UGT1A1-guided treatment appeared to increase safety and reduce hospitalizations and related costs in patients with gastrointestinal cancer. Clinical benefit did not appear to be affected. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03093818.",

      "abstract": "Fluoropyrimidine (FP) chemotherapies are commonly prescribed for upper and lower gastrointestinal, breast and head and neck malignancies. Over 16,000 people with cancer require FP chemotherapies per annum in Australia. Between 10 and 40% patients experience grade 3-4 (&#x2265;&#x2009;G3) toxicities that require hospital-based management&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;intensive care admission. Approximately 1% of patients die secondary to FP toxicities. Prospective screening for DPYD gene variants (encoding the key enzyme for FP catabolism) can identify patients at risk of&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;G3 toxicity and allow for dose adjustment prior to first FP exposure. Evidence supports this as a cost-effective method of improving patient safety and reducing healthcare burden internationally; however, no Australian data confirms its feasibility on a large scale. This investigator-led, single-arm study will determine large scale feasibility of prospective DPYD genotyping, confirming patient safety and cost-effectiveness within the Australian health care system. 5000 patients aged 18&#xa0;years and older with solid organ cancers requiring FP chemotherapy will be consented and genotyped prior to commencing treatment, and early toxicity (within 60&#xa0;days) post-FP exposure will be determined. Toxicity data for DPYD variant carriers who have dose adjustments will be compared to the wild-type cohort and historical cohorts of carriers who did not undergo genotyping prior to FP exposure, and prospective variant carriers who do not undergo dose-adjustment. Prevalence of the four standard DPYD gene variants will be confirmed in an Australian population. Additionally, health economic analysis, implementation research via semi-structured interviews of patients and clinicians, and feasibility of UGT1A1 genotyping will be conducted. This study will determine the prevalence of DPYD gene variant status in Australia and its impact on FP-induced toxicity among Australians with cancer. Feasibility and cost-effectiveness for Australian health care system will be estimated to support national roll-out of prospective DPYD genotyping prior to FP administration. Additionally, feasibility will be confirmed with the intention of including UGT1A1 in future pharmacogenomic panels to aid chemotherapy prescribing.

      "abstract": "FOLFIRI is a standard regimen for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). We hypothesized that a pharmacogenomic-directed strategy where more efficient irinotecan metabolizers (UGT1A1 *1/*1 homozygotes and *1/*28 heterozygotes) receive higher-than-standard irinotecan doses would improve progression-free survival (PFS) compared to non-genotype selected historical controls with acceptable toxicity. In this phase II multicenter study irinotecan dosing in first-line FOLFIRI and bevacizumab for mCRC was based on UGT1A1 genotype with *1/*1, *1/*28, and *28/*28 patients receiving 310 mg/m2, 260 mg/m2, and 180 mg/m2, respectively. Primary endpoint was PFS. Secondary endpoints were investigator and patient-reported adverse events, and estimation of overall survival (OS). One-hundred patients were enrolled with 91 evaluable for PFS and 83 evaluable for best response. Median PFS was 12.5 months (90% CI 10.9, 15.4), shorter than the anticipated alternative hypothesis of 14 months. PFS by genotype was 12.5 months (90% CI 10.9, 17.4) for *1/*1, 14.6 months (90% CI 11.8, 17.5) for *1/*28, and 6 months (90% CI 2.3, 7.7) for *28/28, respectively. OS was 24.5 months (90% CI 19.1, 30.7) and by genotype was 26.5 (90% CI 19.1, 32.9), 25.9 (90% CI 17.6, 37.7), and 13.4 (90% CI 2.3, 20.5) months for *1/*1, *1/*28, and *28/*28, respectively. G3/4 toxicity was similar between all subgroups, including diarrhea and neutropenia. A pharmacogenomic-directed irinotecan strategy improved PFS in the *1/*1 and *1/*28 genotypes with higher rates of neutropenia and similar rates of diarrhea compared to expected with standard FOLFIRI dosing. However, improvements in response rate and PFS were modest. This strategy should not change standard practice for mCRC patients in the first-line setting. &#xa9; The Author(s) 2024.

      "abstract": "Background: Severe delayed diarrhea and hematological toxicity limit the use of irinotecan. Uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 ( UGT1A1 ) is a critical enzyme in irinotecan metabolism. The study aims to investigate the safety and efficacy of irinotecan under the guidance of the pre-treatment UGT1A1 genotype in the second-line treatment of gastric cancer. Methods: This study involved 110 patients. Irinotecan was injected intravenously every 3 weeks, and the dose of irinotecan was determined by polymorphism of the UGT1A1 gene, which was divided into three groups (125&#x2005;mg/m 2 : GG type; 100&#x2005;mg/m 2 : GA type; 75&#x2005;mg/m 2 : AA type). The primary end point was overall survival (OS), the secondary end points were progression-free survival (PFS) and safety. Results: One hundred and seven patients received irinotecan treatment and three patients with AA type received paclitaxel treatment. Among 107 patients, there were no significant differences in PFS (4.8&#x2005;m vs 4.9&#x2005;m vs 4.4&#x2005;m; p&#x2009; =&#x2009;0.5249) and OS (9.3&#x2005;m vs 9.3&#x2005;m vs NA; p&#x2009; =&#x2009;0.6821) among patients with GG/GA/AA subtypes after dose adjustment. For the patient with homozygosity mutation, treatment was switched to paclitaxel. There were no significant differences in PFS and OS among patients with different alleles or after dose adjustment ( p&#x2009; &gt;&#x2009;0.05). There was a significant difference in the risk of delayed diarrhea ( p&#x2009; =&#x2009;0.000), leukopenia ( p&#x2009; =&#x2009;0.003) and neutropenia ( p&#x2009; =&#x2009;0.000) in patients with different UGT1A1*6 genotypes, while no difference in patients with different UGT1A1* 28 genotypes. Additionally, grade 3/4 diarrhea, neutropenia, and leukopenia were significantly more common in AA genotype patients compared to GG (2%, 19%, 24%) or GA (23%, 31%, 31%) genotype patients. Conclusion: Individual irinotecan treatment shows encouraging survival and tolerability outcomes in patients with GG/GA subtype. Irinotecan may be not suitable for patients with AA subtype.",

      "abstract": "Irinotecan plays a crucial role in the neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) of rectal cancer, but its optimal dosing is still unclear. In this study, we included 101 eligible patients with the UGT1A1*28 genotype of UGT1A1*1*1 (74.3%) and UGT1A1*1*28 (25.7%) and UGT1A1*6 genotypes of GG (63.4%), GA (32.7%), and AA (3.9%). All patients received preoperative radiotherapy (50&#x2009;Gy/25 fractions) with concurrent irinotecan (UGT1A1*1*1: 80&#x2009;mg/m 2 ; UGT1A1*1*28: 65&#x2009;mg/m 2 ) and capecitabine (CapIri). SN-38 concentrations were measured at 1.5, 24, and 49&#x2009;h post-administration. Patients were divided into four groups (Q1-Q4) based on the SN-38 concentration. The complete-response (CR) rate was the primary endpoint. The analysis demonstrated that the 49&#x2009;h SN-38 concentration was relatively optimal for predicting efficacy and toxicity. The Q4 group had a significantly higher CR rate than the Q1 group (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.019), but also higher rates of adverse events (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.009). We screened the recommended 49&#x2009;h SN-38, with a 0.5-1.0&#x2009;ng/mL concentration range. We also validated the correlation between UGT1A1*6 polymorphism and SN-38 concentration, along with the clinical efficacy of irinotecan. In conclusion, our study identified the relatively optimal timepoint and concentration range for monitoring SN38 concentrations and revealed the clinical significance of UGT1A1*6 and UGT1A1*28 polymorphisms in guiding irinotecan administration, offering meaningful insights for personalised irinotecan dosing. &#xa9; 2023 UICC.",

      "abstract": "Irinotecan has considerable importance in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). UDP-glucoronyltransferase (UGT) 1A1 is responsible for the inactivation of SN-38, a metabolite of irinotecan. Depending on UGT1A1 polymorphism, the activity of the UGT enzyme can be reduced leading to more frequent occurrence of adverse events related to irinotecan. The present study aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of different doses of irinotecan adjusted according to UGT1A1 polymorphism. Thirty-four patients treated with FOLFIRI as first-line treatment for mCRC were included in this study. The irinotecan dosage was adapted on the basis of UGT1A1 polymorphisms: *1/*1&#xa0;(370&#xa0;mg/m 2 ); *1/*28 (310&#xa0;mg/m 2 ), and *28/*28 (180&#xa0;mg/m 2 ). The incidence of grades 3 and 4 toxicities (neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, and diarrhoea) was recorded. Response was assessed according to the RECIST 1.1 criteria. On the basis of UGT1A1 genotyping, 20 patients were *1/*1 (58.8%), 12 were *1/*28 (35.3%) and 2 were *28/*28 (5.9%). Seven patients experienced at least one severe toxicity, i.e., 21% of the population, amounting to eleven adverse events. Concerning the response rate, 15 patients (44%) had partial or complete response. This study demonstrates that mCRC patients treated with FOLFIRI can tolerate a higher dose of irinotecan than the standard dose, i.e.,&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;180&#xa0;mg/m 2 , on the basis of their UGT1A1 genotype, without increased toxicities.

This study aimed to examine the impact of these genetic polymorphisms on irinotecan outcomes in Thai colorectal cancer patients. The study retrospectively analyzed 41 metastatic colorectal cancer patients treated with irinotecan-based chemotherapy. Genotyping was conducted for 23 single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes including UGT1A1, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CES1, ABCB1, ABCC2, ABCC5, ABCG1, ABCG2, and SLCO1B1.Toxicity and efficacy were assessed, with statistical significance set at a Bonferroni-corrected P value&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.002. In terms of toxicity, UGT1A1*6 was significantly associated with both all-grade and severe neutropenia in the first cycle (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) and severe neutropenia in the second cycle (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.002). Lower absolute neutrophil count was observed among intermediate and poor UGT1A1 metabolizers (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). The ABCC2 -24C&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;T variant was linked to all-grade neutropenia in the second cycle (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001). For efficacy, patients with the wild-type UGT1A1*6 had longer progression-free survival (PFS) (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.002). Additionally, the SLCO1B1 521T&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;C variant was associated with improved PFS (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.002). UGT1A1*6 and ABCC2 -24C&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;T variants emerge as potential predictors of irinotecan-induced neutropenia, while UGT1A1*6 and SLCO1B1 521T&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;C may serve as markers of prolonged PFS in Thai patients.

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives : Pharmacogenetic variability plays a crucial role in determining both the efficacy and toxicity of chemotherapy for gastrointestinal cancers. However, data on allele frequencies and their clinical relevance in Russian populations remain scarce. Methods : We conducted a prospective observational study of 412 patients with gastrointestinal malignancies between 2020 and 2023. Pharmacogenetic testing was performed prior to the initiation of chemotherapy using real-time allele-specific PCR and microarray hybridization technology. Polymorphisms in the DPYD, UGT1A1, CYP2C8, CYP3A5, GSTP1, ERCC1, XPC, CDA, MTHFR, TYMS , and SLC31A1 genes were analyzed. Results : The frequency of most variants was consistent with those reported in European populations, reflecting the ethnic proximity of the studied cohort. Several clinically relevant variants were identified: DPYD rs2297595 occurred more frequently than in European cohorts, and UGT1A1 rs8175347 was observed at a higher prevalence, underscoring the potential risk of irinotecan-related neutropenia and diarrhea. CYP2C8 rs10509681 was present at frequencies comparable to European populations and is associated with an increased risk of taxane-induced peripheral neuropathy. Other markers ( GSTP1, ERCC1, CDA, SLC31A1, MTHFR, TYMS ) demonstrated variable associations with chemotherapy efficacy and toxicity, consistent with findings from previous international studies. Conclusions : This study provides the first comprehensive description of pharmacogenetic polymorphisms in a Russian cohort of patients with gastrointestinal cancers. Our findings confirm the clinical importance of DPYD and UGT1A1 testing and highlight additional variants of potential interest.",

      "abstract": "Patients with advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) commonly receive irinotecan-based systemic treatment to alleviate symptoms, improve quality of life (QoL), and prolong overall survival (OS). However, predicting efficacy and toxicity of the treatment is challenging. Previous research indicated an association between the tumor molecular profile and response to irinotecan-based systemic treatment. Moreover, the UGT1A1 genotype of the patient, and the activity of the gut microbial enzyme &#x3b2;-glucuronidase (GUS) have been suggested as biomarkers for the development of systemic (e.g. neutropenia) and gastrointestinal toxicity (e.g. diarrhea) respectively. Therefore, the OPTIMA study will evaluate in patients with advanced CRC: 1) whether tumor molecular profiling can predict the efficacy of irinotecan-based systemic treatment; 2) whether high bacterial GUS enzyme activity is associated with increased gastrointestinal toxicity, decreased QoL and OS; as well as 3) the safety of a 70% irinotecan dose intensity in UGT1A1 poor metabolizers (PMs). This prospective, observational, multi-center cohort study will include patients with advanced CRC scheduled for irinotecan-based systemic treatment. Archived tumor tissue and routine CT/MRI scans at baseline and after four cycles will be used to investigate the association of tumor molecular profile and treatment response according to RECIST. Before treatment initiation, germline DNA obtained from whole blood will be genotyped using PCR to determine the UGT1A1*28 genotype, followed by 30% irinotecan dose reduction in UGT1A1 PMs. Bacterial GUS activity will be quantified in fecal samples collected before and during treatment by means of an enzyme activity assay and will be related to patient-reported gastrointestinal toxicity (mainly diarrhea). Additionally, patients will fill in questionnaires concerning QoL, medication use, medical history and comorbidities, dietary habits, as well as physical performance. OS will be documented, capturing the duration from the start of treatment until death from any cause. Results obtained in the context of the OPTIMA study are expected to contribute to the optimization of efficacy and the reduction of toxicity of irinotecan-based systemic treatment, thereby potentially improving QoL of patients. Given that maintaining QoL is particularly critical in the palliative setting, the OPTIMA study has the potential to be of significant benefit for patients and their caregivers.

      "abstract": "To date, the clinical benefit and utility of implementing a DPYD/UGT1A1 pharmacogenetic-informed therapy with fluoropyrimidines and/or irinotecan have not been prospectively investigated. To examine clinically relevant toxic effects, hospitalizations, and related costs while preserving treatment intensity and efficacy outcomes in patients with gastrointestinal cancer. This nonprespecified secondary analysis stems from Pre-Emptive Pharmacogenomic Testing for Preventing Adverse Drug Reactions (PREPARE), a multicenter, controlled, open, block-randomized, crossover implementation trial conducted from March 7, 2017, to June 30, 2020, and includes data from Italy according to a sequential study design. The study population included 563 patients (intervention, 252; control [standard of care], 311) with gastrointestinal cancer (age &#x2265;18 years) who were eligible for fluoropyrimidine and/or irinotecan treatment. Data analysis for the present study was performed from May 27 to October 10, 2024. Participants with actionable variants (DPYD*2A, DPYD*13, .DPYD c.2846A&gt;T, and DPYD c.1236G&gt;A for fluoropyrimidines, and UGT1A1*28, UGT1A1*6, and UGT1A1*27 for irinotecan) received drug or dose adjustments based on Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group recommendations. The primary outcome was clinically relevant toxic effects (National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade &#x2265;4 hematologic, grade &#x2265;3 nonhematologic, or causing hospitalization, fluoropyrimidines and/or irinotecan causally related). Secondary outcomes included hospitalization rates, toxic effect management costs, intensity of treatment, quality-adjusted life-years, and 3-year overall survival. Overall, 1232 patients were enrolled in Italy, with 563 included in this analysis (317 [56.3%] men; median age, 68.0 [IQR, 60.0-75.0] years). In the intervention arm, carriers of any actionable genotype exhibited a 90% lower risk of clinically relevant toxic effects compared with the control arm (odds ratio, 0.1; 95% CI, 0.0-0.8; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.04). They also presented higher toxic effect management costs per patient ($4159; 95% CI, $1510-$6810) compared with patients in the intervention arm ($26; 95% CI, 0-$312) (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.004) and a higher rate of hospitalization (34.8% vs 11.8%; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.12). The differences were not significant among all patients. Three-year overall survival did not differ significantly between arms, while quality-adjusted life-years significantly improved in the intervention arm. The pharmacogenetics-informed approach did not manifest a detrimental effect on treatment intensity in actionable genotype carriers. In this secondary analysis of PREPARE, pretreatment application of DPYD- and UGT1A1-guided treatment appeared to increase safety and reduce hospitalizations and related costs in patients with gastrointestinal cancer. Clinical benefit did not appear to be affected. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03093818.",

      "abstract": "Fluoropyrimidine (FP) chemotherapies are commonly prescribed for upper and lower gastrointestinal, breast and head and neck malignancies. Over 16,000 people with cancer require FP chemotherapies per annum in Australia. Between 10 and 40% patients experience grade 3-4 (&#x2265;&#x2009;G3) toxicities that require hospital-based management&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;intensive care admission. Approximately 1% of patients die secondary to FP toxicities. Prospective screening for DPYD gene variants (encoding the key enzyme for FP catabolism) can identify patients at risk of&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;G3 toxicity and allow for dose adjustment prior to first FP exposure. Evidence supports this as a cost-effective method of improving patient safety and reducing healthcare burden internationally; however, no Australian data confirms its feasibility on a large scale. This investigator-led, single-arm study will determine large scale feasibility of prospective DPYD genotyping, confirming patient safety and cost-effectiveness within the Australian health care system. 5000 patients aged 18&#xa0;years and older with solid organ cancers requiring FP chemotherapy will be consented and genotyped prior to commencing treatment, and early toxicity (within 60&#xa0;days) post-FP exposure will be determined. Toxicity data for DPYD variant carriers who have dose adjustments will be compared to the wild-type cohort and historical cohorts of carriers who did not undergo genotyping prior to FP exposure, and prospective variant carriers who do not undergo dose-adjustment. Prevalence of the four standard DPYD gene variants will be confirmed in an Australian population. Additionally, health economic analysis, implementation research via semi-structured interviews of patients and clinicians, and feasibility of UGT1A1 genotyping will be conducted. This study will determine the prevalence of DPYD gene variant status in Australia and its impact on FP-induced toxicity among Australians with cancer. Feasibility and cost-effectiveness for Australian health care system will be estimated to support national roll-out of prospective DPYD genotyping prior to FP administration. Additionally, feasibility will be confirmed with the intention of including UGT1A1 in future pharmacogenomic panels to aid chemotherapy prescribing.

We hypothesized that a pharmacogenomic-directed strategy where more efficient irinotecan metabolizers (UGT1A1 *1/*1 homozygotes and *1/*28 heterozygotes) receive higher-than-standard irinotecan doses would improve progression-free survival (PFS) compared to non-genotype selected historical controls with acceptable toxicity. In this phase II multicenter study irinotecan dosing in first-line FOLFIRI and bevacizumab for mCRC was based on UGT1A1 genotype with *1/*1, *1/*28, and *28/*28 patients receiving 310 mg/m2, 260 mg/m2, and 180 mg/m2, respectively. Primary endpoint was PFS. Secondary endpoints were investigator and patient-reported adverse events, and estimation of overall survival (OS). One-hundred patients were enrolled with 91 evaluable for PFS and 83 evaluable for best response. Median PFS was 12.5 months (90% CI 10.9, 15.4), shorter than the anticipated alternative hypothesis of 14 months. PFS by genotype was 12.5 months (90% CI 10.9, 17.4) for *1/*1, 14.6 months (90% CI 11.8, 17.5) for *1/*28, and 6 months (90% CI 2.3, 7.7) for *28/28, respectively. OS was 24.5 months (90% CI 19.1, 30.7) and by genotype was 26.5 (90% CI 19.1, 32.9), 25.9 (90% CI 17.6, 37.7), and 13.4 (90% CI 2.3, 20.5) months for *1/*1, *1/*28, and *28/*28, respectively. G3/4 toxicity was similar between all subgroups, including diarrhea and neutropenia. A pharmacogenomic-directed irinotecan strategy improved PFS in the *1/*1 and *1/*28 genotypes with higher rates of neutropenia and similar rates of diarrhea compared to expected with standard FOLFIRI dosing. However, improvements in response rate and PFS were modest. This strategy should not change standard practice for mCRC patients in the first-line setting. &#xa9; The Author(s) 2024.

      "abstract": "Background: Severe delayed diarrhea and hematological toxicity limit the use of irinotecan. Uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 ( UGT1A1 ) is a critical enzyme in irinotecan metabolism. The study aims to investigate the safety and efficacy of irinotecan under the guidance of the pre-treatment UGT1A1 genotype in the second-line treatment of gastric cancer. Methods: This study involved 110 patients. Irinotecan was injected intravenously every 3 weeks, and the dose of irinotecan was determined by polymorphism of the UGT1A1 gene, which was divided into three groups (125&#x2005;mg/m 2 : GG type; 100&#x2005;mg/m 2 : GA type; 75&#x2005;mg/m 2 : AA type). The primary end point was overall survival (OS), the secondary end points were progression-free survival (PFS) and safety. Results: One hundred and seven patients received irinotecan treatment and three patients with AA type received paclitaxel treatment. Among 107 patients, there were no significant differences in PFS (4.8&#x2005;m vs 4.9&#x2005;m vs 4.4&#x2005;m; p&#x2009; =&#x2009;0.5249) and OS (9.3&#x2005;m vs 9.3&#x2005;m vs NA; p&#x2009; =&#x2009;0.6821) among patients with GG/GA/AA subtypes after dose adjustment. For the patient with homozygosity mutation, treatment was switched to paclitaxel. There were no significant differences in PFS and OS among patients with different alleles or after dose adjustment ( p&#x2009; &gt;&#x2009;0.05). There was a significant difference in the risk of delayed diarrhea ( p&#x2009; =&#x2009;0.000), leukopenia ( p&#x2009; =&#x2009;0.003) and neutropenia ( p&#x2009; =&#x2009;0.000) in patients with different UGT1A1*6 genotypes, while no difference in patients with different UGT1A1* 28 genotypes. Additionally, grade 3/4 diarrhea, neutropenia, and leukopenia were significantly more common in AA genotype patients compared to GG (2%, 19%, 24%) or GA (23%, 31%, 31%) genotype patients. Conclusion: Individual irinotecan treatment shows encouraging survival and tolerability outcomes in patients with GG/GA subtype. Irinotecan may be not suitable for patients with AA subtype.",

In this study, we included 101 eligible patients with the UGT1A1*28 genotype of UGT1A1*1*1 (74.3%) and UGT1A1*1*28 (25.7%) and UGT1A1*6 genotypes of GG (63.4%), GA (32.7%), and AA (3.9%). All patients received preoperative radiotherapy (50&#x2009;Gy/25 fractions) with concurrent irinotecan (UGT1A1*1*1: 80&#x2009;mg/m 2 ; UGT1A1*1*28: 65&#x2009;mg/m 2 ) and capecitabine (CapIri). SN-38 concentrations were measured at 1.5, 24, and 49&#x2009;h post-administration. Patients were divided into four groups (Q1-Q4) based on the SN-38 concentration. The complete-response (CR) rate was the primary endpoint. The analysis demonstrated that the 49&#x2009;h SN-38 concentration was relatively optimal for predicting efficacy and toxicity. The Q4 group had a significantly higher CR rate than the Q1 group (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.019), but also higher rates of adverse events (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.009).

      "abstract": "Irinotecan has considerable importance in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). UDP-glucoronyltransferase (UGT) 1A1 is responsible for the inactivation of SN-38, a metabolite of irinotecan. Depending on UGT1A1 polymorphism, the activity of the UGT enzyme can be reduced leading to more frequent occurrence of adverse events related to irinotecan. The present study aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of different doses of irinotecan adjusted according to UGT1A1 polymorphism. Thirty-four patients treated with FOLFIRI as first-line treatment for mCRC were included in this study. The irinotecan dosage was adapted on the basis of UGT1A1 polymorphisms: *1/*1&#xa0;(370&#xa0;mg/m 2 ); *1/*28 (310&#xa0;mg/m 2 ), and *28/*28 (180&#xa0;mg/m 2 ). The incidence of grades 3 and 4 toxicities (neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, and diarrhoea) was recorded. Response was assessed according to the RECIST 1.1 criteria. On the basis of UGT1A1 genotyping, 20 patients were *1/*1 (58.8%), 12 were *1/*28 (35.3%) and 2 were *28/*28 (5.9%). Seven patients experienced at least one severe toxicity, i.e., 21% of the population, amounting to eleven adverse events. Concerning the response rate, 15 patients (44%) had partial or complete response. This study demonstrates that mCRC patients treated with FOLFIRI can tolerate a higher dose of irinotecan than the standard dose, i.e.,&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;180&#xa0;mg/m 2 , on the basis of their UGT1A1 genotype, without increased toxicities.

      "abstract": "Irinotecan is a chemotherapy agent commonly prescribed for metastatic colorectal cancer but often leads to neutropenia. Variations in genes encoding drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters may affect the toxicity and effectiveness of irinotecan. This study aimed to examine the impact of these genetic polymorphisms on irinotecan outcomes in Thai colorectal cancer patients. The study retrospectively analyzed 41 metastatic colorectal cancer patients treated with irinotecan-based chemotherapy. Genotyping was conducted for 23 single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes including UGT1A1, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CES1, ABCB1, ABCC2, ABCC5, ABCG1, ABCG2, and SLCO1B1.Toxicity and efficacy were assessed, with statistical significance set at a Bonferroni-corrected P value&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.002. In terms of toxicity, UGT1A1*6 was significantly associated with both all-grade and severe neutropenia in the first cycle (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) and severe neutropenia in the second cycle (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.002). Lower absolute neutrophil count was observed among intermediate and poor UGT1A1 metabolizers (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). The ABCC2 -24C&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;T variant was linked to all-grade neutropenia in the second cycle (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001). For efficacy, patients with the wild-type UGT1A1*6 had longer progression-free survival (PFS) (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.002). Additionally, the SLCO1B1 521T&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;C variant was associated with improved PFS (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.002). UGT1A1*6 and ABCC2 -24C&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;T variants emerge as potential predictors of irinotecan-induced neutropenia, while UGT1A1*6 and SLCO1B1 521T&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;C may serve as markers of prolonged PFS in Thai patients. Validation through larger prospective studies is essential to confirm and refine these genetic associations. Copyright: &#xa9; 2025 Akarapredee et al.

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives : Pharmacogenetic variability plays a crucial role in determining both the efficacy and toxicity of chemotherapy for gastrointestinal cancers. However, data on allele frequencies and their clinical relevance in Russian populations remain scarce. Methods : We conducted a prospective observational study of 412 patients with gastrointestinal malignancies between 2020 and 2023. Pharmacogenetic testing was performed prior to the initiation of chemotherapy using real-time allele-specific PCR and microarray hybridization technology. Polymorphisms in the DPYD, UGT1A1, CYP2C8, CYP3A5, GSTP1, ERCC1, XPC, CDA, MTHFR, TYMS , and SLC31A1 genes were analyzed. Results : The frequency of most variants was consistent with those reported in European populations, reflecting the ethnic proximity of the studied cohort. Several clinically relevant variants were identified: DPYD rs2297595 occurred more frequently than in European cohorts, and UGT1A1 rs8175347 was observed at a higher prevalence, underscoring the potential risk of irinotecan-related neutropenia and diarrhea. CYP2C8 rs10509681 was present at frequencies comparable to European populations and is associated with an increased risk of taxane-induced peripheral neuropathy. Other markers ( GSTP1, ERCC1, CDA, SLC31A1, MTHFR, TYMS ) demonstrated variable associations with chemotherapy efficacy and toxicity, consistent with findings from previous international studies. Conclusions : This study provides the first comprehensive description of pharmacogenetic polymorphisms in a Russian cohort of patients with gastrointestinal cancers. Our findings confirm the clinical importance of DPYD and UGT1A1 testing and highlight additional variants of potential interest.",

      "title": "Evaluation of potential biomarkers during irinotecan-based systemic treatment for colorectal cancer-study protocol of the OPTIMA study.",
      "abstract": "Patients with advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) commonly receive irinotecan-based systemic treatment to alleviate symptoms, improve quality of life (QoL), and prolong overall survival (OS). However, predicting efficacy and toxicity of the treatment is challenging. Previous research indicated an association between the tumor molecular profile and response to irinotecan-based systemic treatment. Moreover, the UGT1A1 genotype of the patient, and the activity of the gut microbial enzyme &#x3b2;-glucuronidase (GUS) have been suggested as biomarkers for the development of systemic (e.g. neutropenia) and gastrointestinal toxicity (e.g. diarrhea) respectively. Therefore, the OPTIMA study will evaluate in patients with advanced CRC: 1) whether tumor molecular profiling can predict the efficacy of irinotecan-based systemic treatment; 2) whether high bacterial GUS enzyme activity is associated with increased gastrointestinal toxicity, decreased QoL and OS; as well as 3) the safety of a 70% irinotecan dose intensity in UGT1A1 poor metabolizers (PMs). This prospective, observational, multi-center cohort study will include patients with advanced CRC scheduled for irinotecan-based systemic treatment. Archived tumor tissue and routine CT/MRI scans at baseline and after four cycles will be used to investigate the association of tumor molecular profile and treatment response according to RECIST. Before treatment initiation, germline DNA obtained from whole blood will be genotyped using PCR to determine the UGT1A1*28 genotype, followed by 30% irinotecan dose reduction in UGT1A1 PMs. Bacterial GUS activity will be quantified in fecal samples collected before and during treatment by means of an enzyme activity assay and will be related to patient-reported gastrointestinal toxicity (mainly diarrhea). Additionally, patients will fill in questionnaires concerning QoL, medication use, medical history and comorbidities, dietary habits, as well as physical performance. OS will be documented, capturing the duration from the start of treatment until death from any cause. Results obtained in the context of the OPTIMA study are expected to contribute to the optimization of efficacy and the reduction of toxicity of irinotecan-based systemic treatment, thereby potentially improving QoL of patients. Given that maintaining QoL is particularly critical in the palliative setting, the OPTIMA study has the potential to be of significant benefit for patients and their caregivers.

      "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer (PC) is an aggressive and lethal tumor with a poor prognosis. FOLFIRINOX improves the prognosis of patients with PC; however, despite UGT1A1 screening, adverse events, such as severe neutropenia, occur frequently. This study aimed to identify the novel biomarkers of severe neutropenia in patients treated with modified FOLFIRINOX (mFFX) for PC. In this study, patients with PC treated with mFFX (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;71) and gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel (GnP) (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;92) and patients with colorectal cancer treated with FOLFOXIRI (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;50) were included. Genome-wide screening using whole-exome sequencing was performed during the screening phase. Validation analysis was performed using polymerase chain reaction genotyping, the Cochran-Armitage trend test, and multivariate analysis. The diagnostic performance of combined risk factors for severe neutropenia was examined using logistic regression with leave-one-out cross-validation. Three gene polymorphisms were selected from the screening phase and subjected to the validation phase. In the validation phase, a single nucleotide polymorphism in C11orf24 (c.448C&gt;T, rs901827) was significantly correlated with &#x2265;&#x2009;Grade 3 neutropenia in mFFX and FOLFOXIRI but not in GnP. Multivariate analysis showed C11orf24 and baseline neutrophil count as independent risk factors for &#x2265;&#x2009;Grade 3 neutropenia. The diagnostic performance of the neutropenia prediction model showed areas under the curve of 0.754 (sensitivity&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.605, specificity&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.848) and 0.856 (sensitivity&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.800, specificity&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.893) for &#x2265;&#x2009;Grade 3 and 4 neutropenia, respectively.

This prospective single arm trial enrolled patients starting FP/irinotecan for any cancer between 7 January 2021 and 25 February 2022 from four Australian hospitals (one metropolitan, three regional). During the accrual period, 462/487 (95%) consecutive patients screened for eligibility for DPYD and 50/109 (46%) for UGT1A1 were enrolled and genotyped (feasibility analysis), with 276/462 (60%) for DPYD and 30/50 (60%) for UGT1A1 received FP/irinotecan (safety analysis). DPYD genotyping identified 96% (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;443/462) Wild-Type, 4% (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;19/462) Intermediate Metabolizers (50% dose reduction), and 0% Poor Metabolizers. UGT1A1 genotyping identified 52% (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;26/50) Wild-Type, 40% (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;20/50) heterozygous, and 8% (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;4/50) homozygous (30% dose reduction). Key demographics for the FP/irinotecan safety cohorts included: age range 23-89/34-74&#x2009;years, male 56%/73%, Caucasian 83%/73%, lower gastrointestinal cancer 50%/57%. Genotype results were reported prior to cycle-1 (96%), average 5-7&#x2009;days from sample collection. PGx-dosing for DPYD variant allele carriers reduced high-grade toxicities compared to historic controls (7% vs. 39%; OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.11, 95% CI 0.01-0.97, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.024).

PGx-dosing reduced FP-related hospitalizations (-22%) and deaths (-3.7%) compared to controls. There were no high-grade toxicities or hospitalizations for UGT1A1*28 homozygotes. PGx screening and prescribing were feasible in routine oncology care and improved patient outcomes. Findings may inform expanded PGx programs within cancer and other disease settings. &#xa9; 2024 The Author(s).

      "abstract": "The regimen with nanoliposomal irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil and L-leucovorin (nal-IRI/FL) is used for metastatic pancreatic cancer. A clinical study has indicated that the uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1 polymorphism is associated with neutropenia during nal-IRI/FL treatment; however, no studies have reported risk factors for the occurrence of adverse events in the clinical setting. This study aimed to explore the risk factors for adverse events of nal-IRI/FL. This study included patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer who started nal-IRI/FL treatment. Patient information, including laboratory data before nal-IRI/FL initiation and adverse events during nal-IRI/FL treatment, was retrospectively obtained from medical records. This study consisted of 36 patients, including 16, 16, and 4 with UGT1A1*6 or *28 wild-type (-/-), heterozygous (+/-), and homozygous (+/+), respectively. Patients with UGT1A1*6 or *28 (+/+) exhibited significantly lower nadir counts of white blood cells (p=0.033) and neutrophils (p=0.043). Multiple regression analyses revealed that the decreased white blood cell count was significantly associated with the genotype of UGT1A1*6 or *28 (+/+) (p=0.009), high aspartate aminotransferase (AST) value before the therapy (p=0.019), and pancreatic head cancer (p=0.030). Also, the decreased neutrophil count was significantly related to the genotype of UGT1A1*6 or *28 (+/+) (p=0.017). Patients with UGT1A1*6 or *28 (+/+) should be especially concerned about neutropenia and leukopenia during nal-IRI/FL treatment.

      "abstract": "Sacituzumab govitecan (SG) is a Trop-2-directed antibody-drug conjugate containing cytotoxic SN-38, the active metabolite of irinotecan. SG received accelerated US Food and Drug Administration approval for locally advanced (LA) or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy and a checkpoint inhibitor, based on cohort 1 of the TROPHY-U-01 study. Mutations in the uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) gene are associated with increased adverse events (AEs) with irinotecan-based therapies. Whether UGT1A1 status could impact SG toxicity and efficacy remains unclear. TROPHY-U-01 (NCT03547973) is a multicohort, open-label, phase II registrational study. Cohort 1 includes patients with LA or mUC who progressed after platinum- and checkpoint inhibitor-based therapies. SG was administered at 10 mg/kg intravenously on days 1 and 8 of 21-day cycles. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) per central review; secondary endpoints included progression-free survival, overall survival, and safety. Post hoc safety analyses were exploratory with descriptive statistics. Updated analyses include longer follow-up. Cohort 1 included 113 patients. At a median follow-up of 10.5 months, ORR was 28% (95% CI 20.2% to 37.6%). Median progression-free survival and overall survival were 5.4 months (95% CI 3.5-6.9 months) and 10.9 months (95% CI 8.9-13.8 months), respectively. Occurrence of grade &#x2265;3 treatment-related AEs and treatment-related discontinuation were consistent with prior reports. UGT1A1 status was wildtype (&#x2217;1|&#x2217;1) in 40%, heterozygous (&#x2217;1|&#x2217;28) in 42%, homozygous (&#x2217;28|&#x2217;28) in 12%, and missing in 6% of patients. In patients with &#x2217;1|&#x2217;1, &#x2217;1|&#x2217;28, and &#x2217;28|&#x2217;28 genotypes, any grade treatment-related AEs occurred in 93%, 94%, and 100% of patients, respectively, and were managed similarly regardless of UGT1A1 status. With longer follow-up, the ORR remains high in patients with heavily pretreated LA or mUC. Safety data were consistent with the known SG toxicity profile. AE incidence varied across UGT1A1 subgroups; however, discontinuation rates remained relatively low for all groups. Copyright &#xa9; 2024 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..

      "abstract": "Pre-therapeutic UGT1A1 genotyping is increasingly performed in patients receiving irinotecan, as its active metabolite SN-38 is primarily cleared through UGT1A1-mediated glucuronidation. Patients with the UGT1A1*28/*28 genotype exhibit reduced UGT1A1 activity, leading to increased SN-38 exposure and a higher risk of adverse events such as neutropenia and diarrhea. Although sacituzumab govitecan contains the same active metabolite as irinotecan, routine UGT1A1 genotyping prior to treatment with this drug is not yet standard practice and is not included in its product information. The aim of this study was to assess whether pre-therapeutic UGT1A1 genotyping may also benefit patients with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative and triple-negative breast cancer who are treated with sacituzumab govitecan. A literature search was conducted to identify relevant studies assessing the impact of UGT1A1 genotyping on the safety and efficacy of sacituzumab govitecan treatment. A meta-analysis was performed on selected studies. Additionally, a pharmacological analysis was performed using public data comparing SN-38 levels in patients treated with sacituzumab govitecan to those receiving irinotecan. The meta-analysis shows that grade &#x2265;&#x2009;3 adverse events, including neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, and diarrhea, occurred more frequently in patients with the *28/*28 genotype. Furthermore, a statistically significant increased risk was found for developing grade &#x2265;&#x2009;3 diarrhea or febrile neutropenia in this group. Although the meta-analysis was underpowered due to small sample sizes, the pharmacological analysis demonstrated higher SN-38 levels in patients treated with sacituzumab govitecan, supporting the rationale for UGT1A1 genotyping in this context. &#xa9; 2025 The Author(s).

      "abstract": "Sacituzumab govitecan (SG), a humanized antibody-drug conjugate, enables intra-tumor delivery of SN-38, the active metabolite of irinotecan, with the aim of increasing efficacy. SN-38 is predominantly inactivated by the polymorphically expressed uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1AA) where reduced activity can lead to toxicity. SG toxicity closely resembles that of irinotecan. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis (PROSPERO ID: CRD42024598820) to assess UGT1A1 genotype as a determinant of SG toxicity. Studies published up to September 29, 2024, on UGT1A1 genotype and SG toxicity were eligible. Risk of bias was assessed using the STROPS guideline. Effect estimates for each genotype, comparing heterozygotes and homozygotes to wild-type, were analyzed. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) and forest plots were generated for each exposure-outcome combination. Four clinical trials including 999 UGT1A1 genotyped subjects were selected for the meta-analysis. SG treatment in UGT1A1*28 homozygous subjects increased the risk of toxicity. The OR (95% CI) was 1.80 (1.03-3.14) for neutropenia, 1.38 (0.90-2.10) for diarrhea, and 1.62 (1.07-2.45) for anemia of any grade, with low heterogeneity (I 2 &#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;28%). The OR for all severe (grade&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;3) toxicities combined was 7.03 (95% CI: 3.41-14.50, I 2 &#x2009;=&#x2009;18%). UGT1A*28 homozygous subjects were more likely to have dose reductions and treatment interruptions compared to wild-type individuals. In conclusion, individuals with UGT1A*28/*28 genotype are at an increased risk of severe SG-related toxicity. Pre-treatment genotyping should be used to identify individuals that may benefit from personalized dosing, closer monitoring or alternative therapies. &#xa9; 2025 The Author(s).

      "abstract": "Colorectal cancer is a leading cause of cancer related deaths among patients worldwide, necessitating the development of more effective and tolerable therapies. Topoisomerase I inhibitors such as Irinotecan are integral components of chemotherapy regimens used in the management of colorectal, as well as esophageal, gastric, biliary tract, pancreatic, neuroendocrine, small bowel and anal carcinomas. Efficacy and toxicity of these regimens are however impacted by metabolism via the UGT1A1 pathways. This literature review provides a comprehensive overview of UGT1A1 polymorphism in patients with colorectal cancer, including recent developments and the future landscape. Recent literature elucidating the roles of oncogenes and predictive biomarkers on anti-cancer drugs and UGT1A1 genotypes are described. The lack of consensus in the clinical management of patients with colorectal cancer were also explored in depth. A comprehensive search was performed in multiple databases (including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, Research gate, and Google Scholar) to identify relevant articles published up to January 2024. A total of 79 clinical studies were included in this review. The epidemiology and frequency of UGT1A1 genes polymorphisms by race, gender, ethnicity, geographic location and stage of the cancer were correlated with drug metabolism, toxicity, and survival outcomes. The tole of UGT1A1 as a prognostic and predictive biomarker, including existing challenges in clinical application were also discussed extensively.

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Irinotecan is used in monotherapy or combined with other drugs for treating different cancer streams. SN-38, the active metabolite of irinotecan, is 70% inactivated by the uridine diphosphate (UDP) glucuronosyltransferase family 1 member A1 (UGT1A1) enzyme. The UGT1A1 *6 (rs4148323) and *28 (rs3064744) alleles in the gene encoding the enzyme lead to decreased enzyme expression and increased severe irinotecan toxicity. Carrying one or two copies of these alleles results in a UGT1A1 intermediate or poor metabolizer status (IM, PM). The Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug labels and European Medicines Agency (EMA) European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) for irinotecan recommend dose adjustments based on UGT1A1 genotypes, but only for UGT1A1 PM patients. However, available pharmacogenetic (PGx) dosing guidelines for the UGT1A1 -irinotecan interaction lack a consensus about considered genetic variants, genotype-translated phenotypes, and therapeutic recommendations. We aimed to describe evidence regarding the impact of the UGT1A1 genotype in irinotecan toxicity to inform irinotecan-dosing recommendations based on possible UGT1A1 genotypes. Methods : A systematic review was performed to find all the Phase I clinical trials looking for the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of irinotecan depending on the UGT1A1 genotype. Results : Toxicity-related events and the MTD of irinotecan differ among UGT1A1 normal metabolizers (NM), IM, and PM patients considering the UGT1A1*28 and/or * 6 variants. Conclusions : Dose adjustments might also be recommended for UGT1A1 IM patients (* 1/*28 or *1/*6 genotypes), with a 15% dose reduction considered.",

      "abstract": "Side effects of irinotecan treatment can be dose limiting and may impair quality of life. In this study, we investigated the correlation between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes encoding enzymes involved in the irinotecan metabolism and transport, outside UGT1A1, and irinotecan-related toxicity. We focused on carboxylesterases, which are involved in formation of the active metabolite SN-38 and on drug transporters. Patients who provided written informed consent at the Erasmus Medical Center Cancer Institute to the Code Geno study (local protocol: MEC02-1002) or the IRI28-study (NTR-6612) were enrolled in the study and were genotyped for 15 SNPs in the genes CES1, CES2, SLCO1B1, ABCB1, ABCC2, and ABCG2. From 299 evaluable patients, 86 patients (28.8%) developed severe irinotecan-related toxicity. A significantly higher risk of toxicity was seen in ABCG2 c.421C&gt;A variant allele carriers (P = 0.030, OR 1.88, 95% CI 1.06-3.34). Higher age was associated with all grade diarrhea (P = 0.041, OR 1.03, 95% CI 1.00-1.06). In addition, CES1 c.1165-41C&gt;T and CES1 n.95346T&gt;C variant allele carriers had a lower risk of all-grade thrombocytopenia (P = 0.024, OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.20-0.90 and P = 0.018, OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.08-0.79, respectively).

      "abstract": "The use of genetic testing to personalize therapeutic strategies in cancer is rapidly evolving and thus changing the landscape of treatment of oncologic patients. The UGT1A1 gene is an important component for the metabolism and glucoronidation of certain drugs, including irinotecan and sacituzumab govitecan (SG); therefore, various UGT1A1 polymorphisms leading to decreased function of the UGT1A1 enzyme may lead to increased risk of treatment-related side effects. Testing for UGT1A1 polymorphism is not routinely adopted in clinical practice; that is due to the lack of concise studies and recommendations concerning the clinical relevance of this test and its impact on the quality of life of cancer patients. The knowledge regarding UGT1A1 polymorphism and its clinical relevance will be reviewed in this article, as well as the published literature on the association between UGT1A1 polymorphism and the toxicity risk of irinotecan as well as sacituzumab govitecan. The current recommendations and guidelines on UGT1A1 testing will be discussed in detail in the hopes of providing guidance to oncologists in their clinical practice.

      "title": "Pharmacogenetic Practice of Anticancer Drugs: Multiple Approaches for an Accurate and Comprehensive Genotyping.",
      "abstract": "The application of pharmacogenetics in oncology is part of the routine clinical practice. In particular, genotyping of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPYD) and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT1A1) is crucial to manage the treatment of patients taking fluoropyrimidines and irinotecan. The unique approach of our laboratory to the pharmacogenetic diagnostic service in oncology is to combine two real-time PCR methods, LightSNiP assay (TIB MOLBIOL), and more recently FRET (Fluorescent Resonance Energy Transfer) probes technology (Nuclear Laser Medicine), plus TaqMan assay (Thermo Fisher) for the confirmation of the presence of variant alleles on DNA from a second extraction. We found that both the FRET and LightSNiP assays, where detection occurs by melting curve analysis, offer an advantage over the competing TaqMan technology. Whereas unexpected genetic variants may be missed using a mutation-specific TaqMan assay, the information thus obtained can be useful to adjust the therapy in case of unexpected post-treatment toxicity. The combination of TaqMan and FRET assays helped us to achieve more accurate genotyping and a correct result for the patient. The added value of the DPYD FRET assay is the possibility of detecting, with the same amplification profile of the polymorphisms detailed in the guidelines, also the c.2194G&gt;A (*6 rs1801160), cited in the recommendations as a variant to be investigated in case of severe toxicity. Regarding the UGT1A1 (TA)n promoter polymorphism (rs3064744), the distinctive and positive feature of the FRET assay is to allow clearly identifying all those potential variant alleles, including the (TA)5 and (TA)8 alleles, that are frequent in African Americans. Our clinical practice emphasizes the importance of not only rapid and easy-to-use assays, such as the new FRET ones, but also of accurate and comprehensive genotyping for good pharmacogenetic diagnostic activity. &#xa9; 2023 Montrasio et al.",

      "abstract": "Irinotecan treatment is often complicated by gastrointestinal, hematological, and infusion-related toxicities, the latter of which typically presents as acute cholinergic syndrome (ACS). While genetic variation in UGT1A1 increases toxicity risk, fewer studies have investigated variation in other genes. This study aimed to assess the impact of variation in other genes involved in irinotecan pharmacokinetics with irinotecan-related toxicity. This was a retrospective study of patients receiving standard irinotecan doses (180&#x2005;mg/m2) with available genetic and clinical data. The primary analysis was to investigate the impact of carboxylesterase (CES) genetic variation on irinotecan infusion-related ACS. Exploratory secondary analyses evaluated variation in CES1, CES2, UGT1A7, UGT1A9, ABCB1, ABCG2, ABCC2, and SLCO1B1 with severe toxicity, treatment modification, diarrhea, and neutropenia. Univariate associations with P less than 0.05 were adjusted for UGT1A1*28 and UGT1A1*6 genotype. A total of 93 patients were included in this analysis. CES1 variants were not associated with infusion-related ACS. In the exploratory analysis, CES1 rs3785161 AA was associated with an increased likelihood of severe irinotecan toxicity (37 vs. 16%; P&#x2005;=&#x2005;0.034), and ABCG2 rs2231142 AA/AC was associated with an increased likelihood of severe neutropenia (33 vs. 8%; P&#x2005;=&#x2005;0.017). CES1 and ABCG2 variants may increase the risk of irinotecan toxicity. Further studies are needed to validate these associations to justify prospective studies investigating the clinical benefits of genetics-guided irinotecan dosing.

      "abstract": "Sacituzumab govitecan is an antineoplastic therapy composed of a monoclonal antibody directed to the Trop2 antigen, conjugated to SN-38, an active metabolite of irinotecan that inhibits topoisomerase I. It is indicated for the treatment of metastatic triple-negative breast cancer in patients who have received at least two prior lines of treatment, with at least one in the metastatic context. SN-38 is eliminated by glucuronidation mediated by uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase-1A1 (UGT1A1) enzymes, present in the liver. Mutations in the UGT1A1 gene decrease the expression of these enzymes, which increases the concentration of SN-38 and, consequently, increases the toxicity of the drug, especially in the form of neutropenia and diarrhea. This study aims to analyze the relationship between UGT1A1 gene polymorphisms and toxicity associated with treatment with sacituzumab govitecan, in addition to reviewing the usefulness of genetic screening prior to starting therapy. A non-systematic literature review was conducted on the impact of UGT1A1 gene polymorphisms on the safety of sacituzumab govitecan treatment in patients with triple-negative breast cancer. The search included primary and secondary literature sources and communications from oncology conferences. Patients treated with sacituzumab govitecan with the UGT1A1*28/*28 mutated genotype are more likely to experience grade more than 3 hematologic adverse events: neutropenia (approximate incidence of 60% compared to 40% for 1/*1 and 1/*28 genotypes), febrile neutropenia (18% homozygotes vs. 5% heterozygotes and 3% wild-type), grade more than 3 anemia (15% vs. 6% and 4%, respectively); as well as grade more than 3 diarrhea (24% vs. 13% and 6%, respectively). Additionally, treatment discontinuation rates are higher in *28/*28 individuals (6% compared to 1% heterozygotes and 2% wild-type). Patients homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele are at significantly increased risk of developing serious adverse events. Despite the clear relationship between UGT1A1 polymorphisms and sacituzumab-govitecan toxicity, the review suggests that there is insufficient consensus on the need for systematic genetic screening. However, the findings indicate that such screening could be useful for identifying patients at risk and personalizing sacituzumab govitecan therapy. Copyright &#xa9; 2025.

      "abstract": "Neutropenia is the major dose-limiting toxicity of irinotecan-based therapy. The objective of this study was to assess whether inclusion of germline genetic variants into a population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model can improve prediction of irinotecan-induced grade 4 neutropenia and identify novel variants of clinical value. A semimechanistic population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model was used to predict neutrophil response over time in 197 patients receiving irinotecan. Covariate analysis was performed for demographic/clinical factors and 4,781 genetic variants in 84 drug response- and toxicity-related genes to identify covariates associated with neutrophil response. We evaluated the predictive value of the model for grade 4 neutropenia reflecting different clinical scenarios of available data on identified demographic/clinical covariates, baseline and post-treatment absolute neutrophil counts (ANCs), individual pharmacokinetics, and germline genetic variation. Adding 8 genetic identified covariates (rs10929302 (UGT1A1), rs1042482 (DPYD), rs2859101 (HLA-DQB3), rs61754806 (NR3C1), rs9266271 (HLA-B), rs7294 (VKORC1), rs1051713 (ALOX5), and ABCB1 rare variant burden) to a model using only baseline ANCs improved prediction of irinotecan-induced grade 4 neutropenia from area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) of 50-64% (95% confidence interval (CI), 54-74%). Individual pharmacokinetics further improved the prediction to 74% (95% CI, 64-84%). When weekly ANC was available, the identified covariates and individual pharmacokinetics yielded no additional contribution to the prediction. The model including only ANCs at baseline and at week 1 achieved an AUC-ROC of 78% (95% CI, 69-88%). Germline DNA genetic variants may contribute to the prediction of irinotecan-induced grade 4 neutropenia when incorporated into a population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model. This approach is generalizable to drugs that induce neutropenia and ultimately allows for personalized intervention to enhance patient safety. &#xa9; 2024 The Authors.
