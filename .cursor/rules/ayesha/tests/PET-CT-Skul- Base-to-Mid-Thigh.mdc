PET-CT Skull Base to Mid-Thigh
Results
Narrative & Impression
EXAMINATION:
PET CT SKULL BASE TO MID THIGH
CLINICAL INFORMATION:
Tumor or Primary Diagnosis: Carcinomatosis, unknown primary.
Indication: For initial staging for known malignancy; evaluation for initial
treatment planning.
Additional Clinical Information: Status post colectomy demonstrating
multiple tubular adenomas.
TECHNIQUE:
Blood glucose pre-injection measured 78 mg/dL. Approximately 50 minutes
after intravenous administration of 10 millicuries of F18-FDG into the right
antecubital vein, a CT attenuation-corrected PET scan from the canthomeatal
line to the mid-thigh was acquired. Multiplanar PET-CT fusion images were
constructed. SUV will be reported as maximum value.
COMPARISON:
CT chest 11/05/2025
CT abdomen pelvis 10/28/2025
CT abdomen pelvis 01/31/2024
FINDINGS:
HEAD and NECK:
Lymph nodes:
Few scattered subcentimeter FDG-avid bilateral cervical nodes.
CHEST:
Lungs:
Large portions of the lower lobes and right middle lobe are atelectatic
adjacent to the pleural effusions.
The upper lobes are relatively well-aerated. There is also atelectasis in
the lingula.
Pleura:
Multiple FDG-avid pleural and pericardial deposits bilaterally SUVs ranging
between 6 and 7.
Persistent large layering bilateral pleural effusions.
Airway: The trachea and bronchi are patent.
Mediastinum, hila and lymph nodes:
Many small FDG-avid bilateral axillary, supraclavicular, and mediastinal
lymph nodes.
Largest right axillary 1.8 x 1.1 cm SUV max 9.5.

Various mediastinal nodes are subcentimeter SUVs around 6.
Heart, vascular structures and pericardium: The heart, major vessels and
pericardium are normal.
ABDOMEN/PELVIS:
Lymph nodes:
There are innumerable FDG-avid upper abdominal, retroperitoneal, and
bilateral iliac chain lymph nodes. These nodes measure up to 2 x 1.5 cm
maximally in the pelvis. Upper abdominal nodes are smaller. SUVs of the
lymph nodes measure between 8 and 10.
Soft tissue/organs:
Extensive carcinomatosis is present, with moderate volume ascites. The
largest tumor conglomerate measures 8 cm in the right lower quadrant SUV max
15. There are innumerable implants. There is extensive omental caking.
A left adnexal cystic lesion is difficult to distinguish from background
ascites (3:137) but was larger on the scan from 01/31/2024. It demonstrates
FDG-avid elements at its periphery, difficult to distinguish from implants.
FDG-avid areas localized to both the endometrium SUV max 6.2 (4:146) and the
uterine cervix SUV max 11 (4:152). An intrauterine device is present.
No hydronephrosis.
Status post colectomy. The rectum is still present.
MUSCULOSKELETAL:
3.0 x 2.5 cm low-density FDG-avid soft tissue lesion in the proximal aspect
of the left arm SUV max 4.2 (4:23).
Various small FDG-avid soft tissue lesions are present within the
musculature surrounding the chest wall.
IMPRESSION:
Extensive carcinomatosis with moderate volume ascites, bilateral pleural
metastatic disease with persistent large layering bilateral pleural
effusions, soft tissue metastases, and extensive cervical, thoracic, and
abdominopelvic nodal metastases.
Suspect a gynecologic primary, either left adnexal, endometrial, or
cervical.
