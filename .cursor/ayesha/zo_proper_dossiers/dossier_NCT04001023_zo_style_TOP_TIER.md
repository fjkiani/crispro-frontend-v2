## 4. TRIAL DESCRIPTION

The goal of this non-randomized prospective study is to use 18F-EF5-PET/CT imaging to identify and locate intraabdominal hypoxic ovarian cancer lesions. With targeted surgical sampling, precisely obtain hypoxic and potentially chemoresistant cancer tissue for our analyses and identify key molecular differences between hypoxic and non-hypoxic tumors within the same patient.

A portion of advanced stage EOC are inoperable at diagnosis and can be treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) before surgery. This approach offers a unique opportunity to study how hypoxic tumor areas respond to treatment.
