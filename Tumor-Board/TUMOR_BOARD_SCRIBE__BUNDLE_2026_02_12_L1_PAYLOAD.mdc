title: "Tumor Board Scribe — Ayesha Bundle (L1) 2026-02-12 (INDEX ONLY)"
ruo: true
status: "INDEX_ONLY"
reason:
  - "Tumor-board quoting material must be payload-bounded."
  - "Engineering re-runs/code paths must be kept separate to avoid trust loss under payload drift."
---

## ✅ Use these three split documents (quote-safe + engineering + queue)

- **Bundle-only tumor board packet (quote-safe)**: `TUMOR_BOARD_PACKET__BUNDLE_ONLY.md`
  - Contract: JSON-field-path evidence only; if silent, say **Unknown** and name the missing field.
  - No re-runs. No backend code. No equations.

- **Engineering explanations (why the JSON looks like it does)**: `ENGINE_EXPLANATIONS__WHY_THE_BUNDLE_LOOKS_LIKE_THIS.md`
  - Code paths, equations, config flags, re-run receipts, drift analysis.

- **Open questions / mission queue (receipts required)**: `OPEN_QUESTIONS__MISSION_QUEUE.md`
  - One mission → one proof artifact; acceptance criteria must be satisfiable by receipts.

## Source artifacts (captured payload + receipts)

- Captured bundle: `artifacts/payload.md`
- Machine-extracted JSON: `artifacts/payload.extracted.json`
- Evidence autopsy receipt: `artifacts/mission2_evidence_autopsy_2026-02-13.json`
