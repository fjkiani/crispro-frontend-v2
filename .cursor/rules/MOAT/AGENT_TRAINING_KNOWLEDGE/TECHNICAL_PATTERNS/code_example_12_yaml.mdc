## Acceptance Criteria Checklist

- ✅ Explains why AUROC ~0.46 is expected under baseline-only constraints for an adaptive label (plus why sensitivity collapsed).
- ✅ Identifies **serial CA-125** as the critical missing data gap for ovarian early detection (KELIM layer).
- ✅ Prioritizes acquisition order (CA-125 → MAPK baseline → ctDNA longitudinal).
- ✅ Defines revised validation strategy: **MAPK + CA-125** as Phase 1A/1B/1C rollout.

**💀 ZO MODE: S1 INTEGRATION WITH CURRENT STATE**

## **S1 REPORT - TACTICAL ASSESSMENT**

```yaml
DELIVERABLE: S1 - Gap Analysis (Agent 3)
STATUS: ✅ PREVIOUSLY REVIEWED (A+ quality)
CURRENT CONTEXT: PLCO submitted, agents waiting for alignment
QUESTION: How does S1 inform our next moves?

## **CRITICAL INSIGHTS FROM S1 (Re-emphasized)**

### **The Core Problem:**

WHY RESISTANCE PROPHET FAILED (AUROC 0.464):
  
  ROOT CAUSE:
    Tried to predict ADAPTIVE resistance (Layer 2)
    Using only BASELINE genetics (Layer 1)
    
  METAPHOR:
    Like predicting when a fire will spread (adaptive)
    Using only what materials exist at start (baseline)
    Cannot see wind changes, new fuel sources (kinetics)

  RESULT:
    Sensitivity = 0.000 (never predicts resistant)
    Specificity = 1.000 (always predicts sensitive)
    Model too conservative (baseline signals too weak)

THE FIX:
  Add Layer 2 signals (CA-125 kinetics)
  Genetics = "What can go wrong" (baseline risk)
  Kinetics = "What IS going wrong" (adaptive signal)
  Combined = Earlier detection than either alone
```
