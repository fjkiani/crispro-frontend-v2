Reviewing the codebase knowledge base. Current understanding:

**Status:**
- Reviewed foundational systems (Ayesha Care, S/P/E Framework, Sporadic Cancer Strategy, SAE Integration, Resistance Playbook)
- Traced data flows: CA-125 Intelligence, Resistance Prophet, SAE Features
- Identified integration gaps and discrepancies

**Recent work:**
- Phase 1 iteration: 3/7 traces complete
- Identified critical discrepancies (e.g., `analyze_kinetics()` method missing)
- Documented system connections and data flow patterns

**Current task (from .cursorrules):**
- Synthetic lethality manuscript polish: fix typos, tighten claims to receipt-backed results, improve reproducibility pointers

What should I focus on?
1. Continue manuscript polish
2. Address the identified discrepancies (e.g., `analyze_kinetics()`)
3. Continue Phase 1 iteration (remaining traces)
4. Something else

How do you want to proceed?
