      "title": "Population Pharmacokinetic Quantification of CYP2D6 Activity in Codeine Metabolism in Ambulatory Surgical Patients for Model-Informed Precision Dosing.",
      "abstract": "Codeine metabolism in humans is complex due to the involvement of multiple cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, and has a strong genetic underpinning, which determines the levels of relevant CYP450 enzyme expression in vivo. Polymorphic CYP2D6 metabolises codeine to morphine via O-demethylation, while a strong correlation between CYP2D6 phenotype and opioidergic adverse effects of codeine is well documented. The aim of this study was to quantify the effect of CYP2D6 genotype on the biotransformation of codeine. We conducted a prospective clinical trial with 1000 patients, during which ambulatory patients were administered 60 mg of codeine preoperatively and the association between CYP2D6 activity and morphine exposure across various CYP2D6 genotypes was quantified using a population pharmacokinetic model. Plasma concentration data for codeine and its primary metabolites were obtained from 997 patients and CYP2D6 genotype was screened for study subjects, and respective sums of activity scores assigned for each CYP2D6 allele were used as covariates in model development. Our final model predicts the disposition of codeine and the formation of morphine, codeine-6-glucuronide and morphine-3-glucuronide adequately while accounting for variability in morphine exposure on the basis of CYP2D6 genotype. In agreement with previous results, patients with decreased function alleles (CYP2D6*10 and *41) showed varying levels of decrease in CYP2D6 activity that were inconsistent with increasing activity scores. Model simulations demonstrate that morphine concentrations in ultrarapid CYP2D6 metabolisers reach systemic concentrations that can potentially cause respiratory depression (over 9.1 ng/mL), and have 218% higher exposure (19 versus 8.7 &#xb5;g &#xb7; h/L, p &lt; 0.001) to morphine than normal metabolisers. Similarly, poor and intermediate metabolisers had significantly reduced morphine exposure (1.0 and 3.7 versus 8.7 &#xb5;g &#xb7; h/L, p &lt; 0.001) as compared with normal metabolisers. Our final model leads the way in implementing model-informed precision dosing in codeine therapy and identifies the use of genetic testing as an integral component in the effort to implement rational pharmacotherapy with codeine. &#xa9; 2024.

      "title": "Implementing a pragmatic clinical trial to tailor opioids for chronic pain on behalf of the IGNITE ADOPT PGx investigators.",
      "abstract": "Chronic pain is a prevalent condition with enormous economic burden. Opioids such as tramadol, codeine, and hydrocodone are commonly used to treat chronic pain; these drugs are activated to more potent opioid receptor agonists by the hepatic CYP2D6 enzyme. Results from clinical studies and mechanistic understandings suggest that CYP2D6-guided therapy will improve pain control and reduce adverse drug events. However, CYP2D6 is rarely used in clinical practice due in part to the demand for additional clinical trial evidence. Thus, we designed the ADOPT-PGx (A Depression and Opioid Pragmatic Trial in Pharmacogenetics) chronic pain study, a multicenter, pragmatic, randomized controlled clinical trial, to assess the effect of CYP2D6 testing on pain management. The study enrolled 1048 participants who are taking or being considered for treatment with CYP2D6-impacted opioids for their chronic pain. Participants were randomized to receive immediate or delayed (by 6&#x2009;months) genotyping of CYP2D6 with clinical decision support (CDS). CDS encouraged the providers to follow the CYP2D6-guided trial recommendations. The primary study outcome is the 3-month absolute change in the composite pain intensity score assessed using Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) measures. Follow-up will be completed in July 2024. Herein, we describe the design of this trial along with challenges encountered during enrollment. &#xa9; 2024 The Author(s).

      "title": "Study on the association between adverse drug reactions to opioids and gene polymorphisms: a case-case-control study.",
      "abstract": "Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) caused by opioid drugs show individual differences. Our objective was to explore the association between gene polymorphism and ADRs induced by opioid drugs. Evidence-based medical data analysis was conducted for genes related to ADRs induced by opioid drugs to select target genes. Sixty patients with cancer pain who had ADRs after taking opioid drugs (morphine, codeine, oxycodone) and 60 patients without ADRs after taking opioid drugs were used as the experimental group and control group, respectively. Then, we used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or in situ hybridization to detect target genes. By combining with clinical data such as age, sex, dosage and duration of medication, the effect of gene polymorphism on the ADR of patients after taking opioid drugs was statistically analysed. Based on a database search and evidence-based medical data, we identified CYP2D6*10, CYP3A5*3, ABCB1, and OPRM1 as target genes for detection. The results of statistical analysis showed no significant difference in genotype distribution between the experimental group and the control group (p&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.05). However, if 32 patients with ADRs after taking oxycodone and 32 controls were selected for comparison, the SPSS22.0 and SNPStats genetic models showed that the ABCB1 (062rs1045642) CT and TT genotypes correlated with the occurrence of ADRs (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05): the total number of CT&#x2009;+&#x2009;TT genotypes in the experimental group was 29 (90.62%), with 11 (34.37%) CT&#x2009;+&#x2009;TT genotypes types in the control group. Polymorphism of ABCB1 (062rs1045642) is related to ADRs caused by oxycodone, and the incidence of ADRs is higher with the allele T. Polymorphism of ABCB1 is expected to become a clinical predictor of ADRs to oxycodone, and attention should be given to the occurrence of serious ADRs in patients with ABCB1 (062rs1045642) CT and TT genotypes. &#xa9; 2023.

      "abstract": "Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is highly prevalent in Nigeria, with severe pain crises being a primary cause of morbidity. Codeine and tramadol are frequently used opioids, but their effectiveness and safety are significantly influenced by CYP2D6 genetic variations. Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guidelines exist for opioid therapy based on CYP2D6 phenotypes. There's a critical need for pre-emptive pharmacogenomic (PGx) testing in African SCD patients to guide opioid selection. This study aimed to determine CYP2D6 allele, phenotype frequencies and evaluate the feasibility of implementing pre-emptive pharmacogenomic (PGx) testing to guide opioid therapy for SCD patients in Nigeria. This prospective, multicenter implementation study recruited 503 consenting SCD patients (HbSS or HbSC) aged &#x2265;15 years from five Nigerian sites. Blood samples were collected for DNA extraction. CYP2D6 single-nucleotide polymorphisms and copy number variations were determined using Taqman assays based open array, GenoPharm. Phenotypes were assigned based on Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guidelines using the Genomics Information Management System (GIMS). and patient-specific medication safety cards were generated. We successfully genotyped 503 SCD patients with a mean age of 25.1 years, while 61.4% were female, and hydroxyurea use was less than 9.4%. Actionable CYP2D6 variants were found in 36.6% of participants. The predicted phenotype distribution was 8.8% Ultrarapid Metabolizers (UM), 54.1% Normal Metabolizers (NM), 26.0% Intermediate Metabolizers (IM), and 1.8% Poor Metabolizers (PM), with 9.3% undetermined. Patient medication safety cards were provided to guide prescriptions. This study successfully established a genotyped cohort of 503 Nigerian SCD patients, demonstrating the feasibility of pre-emptive pharmacogenetic testing through a Pan-African collaborative model in a resource-limited setting. The identification of PM and UM provides direct clinical guidance, as CPIC guidelines recommend avoiding codeine and tramadol in these groups due to the high risk of diminished efficacy or serious toxicity, respectively. The high prevalence of actionable CYP2D6 variants indicates a substantial proportion of Nigerian SCD patients may experience altered opioid responses, underscoring the need for tailored prescribing to optimise pain control and minimise adverse drug reactions.

      "title": "Opioids in the Brazilian Healthcare Landscape: Crucial Analysis through Anvisa VigiMed Data and Pharmacogenetic Aspects.",
      "abstract": "Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) present a significant challenge to healthcare systems, contributing substantially to hospital admissions. Opioid analgesics are widely used in the pharmacological treatment of various types of pain; however, ADRs represent a major limitation to their use. This study aims to investigate the profile of ADRs reported in Vigimed (the official Brazilian ADR reporting system) following the implementation of active surveillance through pharmacovigilance trackers. Additionally, it evaluates pharmacogenetic evidence to identify genes potentially involved in opioid-related ADRs. This retrospective cross-sectional study analyzed ADR cases reported to Vigimed from January 2018 to April 2023. Data were extracted from Vigimed, tabulated, and subjected to statistical analysis, using the reporting odds ratio (ROR) to assess the strength of associations between opioids and ADRs. During the study period, there were 238,363 ADR reports, of which 6,001 were related to opioid treatment. The distribution among opioids was as follows: 36.7% morphine, 32.4% tramadol, 21.6% fentanyl, 5.4% methadone, 3.7% codeine, and 0.2% oxycodone. The most frequent adverse events associated with opioids were cardiac disorders (ROR 1.70), skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (ROR 2.18), gastrointestinal disorders (ROR 2.88), and nervous system disorders (ROR 1.19). Furthermore, pharmacogenetic evidence indicates that the CYP2D6 gene has a Level 1 association for codeine and tramadol and a Level 2 association for oxycodone. These findings highlight significant associations between specific opioids and ADRs, emphasizing the influence of genetic variations on adverse reactions and the need for personalized medicine in pain management. &#xa9; 2025 The Authors.

      "abstract": "This trial aimed to identify the effects of providing pharmacogenomic (PGx) results and recommendations for patients with chronic pain treated in primary care practices compared to standard care. An open-label, prospective, largely virtual, type-2 hybrid effectiveness trial randomized participants to PGx or standard care arms. Adults with pain &#x2265;&#x2009;3 months who were treated with tramadol, codeine, or hydrocodone enrolled. Alternative analgesics were recommended for CYP2D6 intermediate or poor metabolizers (IM/PMs). Prescribing decisions were at providers' discretion. The trial randomized 253 participants. A modified intent-to-treat primary analysis assessed change in pain intensity over 3&#x2009;months among IM/PMs (PGx: 49; Standard care: 57). The PGx and standard care arms showed no difference in pain intensity change (-0.10&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.63 vs. -0.21&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.75 standard deviation; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.74) or PGx-aligned care (69% vs. 63%; standardized difference [SD]&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.13). In IM/PMs, secondary analyses of pain intensity change suggested improvements with PGx-aligned (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;70; -0.21&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.70) vs. unaligned care (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;36; -0.06&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.69) (SD&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.22), with this difference increasing when examining IM/PMs with an analgesic change (aligned: n&#x2009;=&#x2009;31, -0.28&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.76; unaligned: n&#x2009;=&#x2009;36, -0.06&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.69; SD&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.31). This approach to PGx implementation for chronic pain was not associated with different prescribing (i.e., similar proportions of PGx-aligned care) or clinical outcomes. Secondary analyses suggest that prescribing aligned with PGx recommendations showed a small improvement in pain intensity. However, the proportion of patients with a clinically meaningful improvement (&#x2265;&#x2009;30%) in pain intensity was similar. Future efforts should identify effective implementation methods. &#xa9; 2025 The Author(s).

      "title": "Case Report: Performing a Medication Safety Review Assisted by Pharmacogenomics to Explain a Prescribing Cascade Resulting in a Patient Fall.",
      "abstract": "Pharmacotherapy for major depressive disorder (MDD) typically consists of trial-and-error and clinician preference approaches, where patients often fail one or more antidepressants before finding an optimal regimen. Pharmacogenomics (PGx) can assist in prescribing appropriate antidepressants, thereby reducing the time to MDD remission and occurrence of adverse drug events. Since many antidepressants are metabolized by and/or inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes (e.g., CYP2C19 or CYP2D6), drug-induced phenoconversion is common in patients on antidepressant combinations. This condition influences the interpretation of a patient's PGx results, overall risk of ineffective/adverse medication response due to multi-drug interactions, and the recommendations. This complex case describes a patient with MDD, generalized anxiety disorder, and chronic pain who experienced a fall due to excessive sedation following a prescribing cascade of fluoxetine, bupropion, and doxepin. These antidepressants delivered a significant additive sedative effect and interacted with the patient's hydrocodone, potentially contributing to uncontrolled pain, upward dose titration of hydrocodone, and a higher overall sedative burden. The PGx results and drug-induced phenoconversion described in this case report explain the patient's excessive sedation and possibly ineffective/toxic antidepressant and opioid treatment. This case report also illustrates how a more timely multi-drug interaction assessment (preferably in conjunction with preemptive PGx testing) may have informed a different prescribing pattern, reduced/avoided a prescribing cascade, and potentially prevented a drug-related fall.",

Reduced CYP2D6 activity may be associated with poor pain control. To evaluate associations of impaired CYP2D6 activity based on genotype or CYP2D6 inhibitors, alone and together, with analgesic activity of CYP2D6-metabolized opioids among patients with pain. This retrospective national, community-based cohort study used electronic health records and genetics data from the All of Us Research Program. Participants included adults prescribed at least 1 CYP2D6-metabolized opioid for more than 7 days between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2022, with whole-genome sequencing data available. Analysis groups were defined by CYP2D6 phenotype, which was determined based on CYP2D6 genotype or CYP2D6 inhibitor-mediated phenoconversion. Statistical analysis was performed from July 1, 2023, to January 15, 2025. CYP2D6-metabolized opioids, with or without concomitant CYP2D6 inhibitor exposure, based on prescription records and overlap with opioids. The primary outcome was occurrence of any pain-related emergency department (ED) visits during opioid treatment, up to 60 days after opioid initiation. The association between ED visits and CYP2D6 phenotype was assessed using inverse probability treatment weighting-adjusted logistic regression. Additional analyses were conducted by drug and isolating CYP2D6 genotype and inhibitors. Among 31&#x202f;669 patients (mean [SD] age, 51.2 [15.4] years; 66.5% women) prescribed CYP2D6-metabolized opioids, 15&#x202f;960 had reduced CYP2D6 activity, and 15&#x202f;709 had normal or high CYP2D6 activity based on genotype and inhibitors. A higher percentage of patients with reduced CYP2D6 activity (hereafter referred to as phenotypic intermediate metabolizers [pIMs] or phenotypic poor metabolizers [pPMs]) had experienced pain-related ED visits compared with patients with normal or high CYP2D6 activity (phenotypic normal metabolizers [pNMs] and phenotypic ultrarapid metabolizers [pUMs]) (2.1% vs 1.8%; inverse probability-weighted odds ratio, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.06-1.33). There were no significant differences in ED visits among CYP2D6 genotypic IMs or PMs vs NMs or UMs when testing all 4 drugs together. Among genotypic NMs, ED visits were more frequent among the individuals prescribed CYP2D6 inhibitors (inverse probability-weighted odds ratio, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.32-1.68). In analyses by medication, drug interactions were important for all 4 medications, while genotype associations were significant only for hydrocodone, tramadol, and codeine. In this cohort study, reduced CYP2D6 activity was associated with increased ED visits among individuals treated with CYP2D6-metabolized opioids. This finding suggests that incorporating data on CYP2D6 genotype and accounting for drug interactions in opioid prescribing may improve pain management and reduce ED visits.",

CYP2D6 plays a crucial role in metabolizing analgesics such as tramadol, codeine, and oxycodone. It is also suspected to be involved in the synthesis of catecholamines and endogenous morphines suggesting a potential role in pathophysiology of pain. We hypothesize that the CYP2D6 activity influences the development of postoperative pain after hernia surgery. This study is a prospective, observational, multicenter association study investigating adult patients scheduled for inguinal hernia surgery using a robotic-assisted (rTAPP) approach. Patients are enrolled during the preoperative surgical consultation. A buccal swab is collected for genetic testing at this time. Pain at the site of the hernia is assessed using the validated EuraHSQoL score preoperatively and at 2, 4, and 6&#xa0;weeks postoperatively. Additionally, information on co-medication and details of the surgery will be collected. The planned number of participants is 350 patients. The primary objective is to analyze the association between different genotype-predicted CYP2D6 phenotypes and patient-reported pain intensity 6&#xa0;weeks after surgery. Secondary objectives include the association between further genetic variants, such as the COMT rs4680 and OPRM1 rs1799971 genotype, and pain severity. Additionally, the potential of pharmacogenetic panel testing to optimize analgesic therapy in hernia surgery patients will be explored. The findings of this study are expected to provide valuable insights into identifying patients at higher risk for postoperative pain before surgery. This knowledge could pave the way for tailored interventions during and after surgery for these specific patients.

      "title": "Population Pharmacokinetic Quantification of CYP2D6 Activity in Codeine Metabolism in Ambulatory Surgical Patients for Model-Informed Precision Dosing.",
      "abstract": "Codeine metabolism in humans is complex due to the involvement of multiple cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, and has a strong genetic underpinning, which determines the levels of relevant CYP450 enzyme expression in vivo. Polymorphic CYP2D6 metabolises codeine to morphine via O-demethylation, while a strong correlation between CYP2D6 phenotype and opioidergic adverse effects of codeine is well documented. The aim of this study was to quantify the effect of CYP2D6 genotype on the biotransformation of codeine. We conducted a prospective clinical trial with 1000 patients, during which ambulatory patients were administered 60 mg of codeine preoperatively and the association between CYP2D6 activity and morphine exposure across various CYP2D6 genotypes was quantified using a population pharmacokinetic model. Plasma concentration data for codeine and its primary metabolites were obtained from 997 patients and CYP2D6 genotype was screened for study subjects, and respective sums of activity scores assigned for each CYP2D6 allele were used as covariates in model development. Our final model predicts the disposition of codeine and the formation of morphine, codeine-6-glucuronide and morphine-3-glucuronide adequately while accounting for variability in morphine exposure on the basis of CYP2D6 genotype. In agreement with previous results, patients with decreased function alleles (CYP2D6*10 and *41) showed varying levels of decrease in CYP2D6 activity that were inconsistent with increasing activity scores. Model simulations demonstrate that morphine concentrations in ultrarapid CYP2D6 metabolisers reach systemic concentrations that can potentially cause respiratory depression (over 9.1 ng/mL), and have 218% higher exposure (19 versus 8.7 &#xb5;g &#xb7; h/L, p &lt; 0.001) to morphine than normal metabolisers. Similarly, poor and intermediate metabolisers had significantly reduced morphine exposure (1.0 and 3.7 versus 8.7 &#xb5;g &#xb7; h/L, p &lt; 0.001) as compared with normal metabolisers. Our final model leads the way in implementing model-informed precision dosing in codeine therapy and identifies the use of genetic testing as an integral component in the effort to implement rational pharmacotherapy with codeine. &#xa9; 2024.

      "title": "Implementing a pragmatic clinical trial to tailor opioids for chronic pain on behalf of the IGNITE ADOPT PGx investigators.",
      "abstract": "Chronic pain is a prevalent condition with enormous economic burden. Opioids such as tramadol, codeine, and hydrocodone are commonly used to treat chronic pain; these drugs are activated to more potent opioid receptor agonists by the hepatic CYP2D6 enzyme. Results from clinical studies and mechanistic understandings suggest that CYP2D6-guided therapy will improve pain control and reduce adverse drug events. However, CYP2D6 is rarely used in clinical practice due in part to the demand for additional clinical trial evidence. Thus, we designed the ADOPT-PGx (A Depression and Opioid Pragmatic Trial in Pharmacogenetics) chronic pain study, a multicenter, pragmatic, randomized controlled clinical trial, to assess the effect of CYP2D6 testing on pain management. The study enrolled 1048 participants who are taking or being considered for treatment with CYP2D6-impacted opioids for their chronic pain. Participants were randomized to receive immediate or delayed (by 6&#x2009;months) genotyping of CYP2D6 with clinical decision support (CDS). CDS encouraged the providers to follow the CYP2D6-guided trial recommendations. The primary study outcome is the 3-month absolute change in the composite pain intensity score assessed using Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) measures. Follow-up will be completed in July 2024. Herein, we describe the design of this trial along with challenges encountered during enrollment. &#xa9; 2024 The Author(s).

      "abstract": "Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) caused by opioid drugs show individual differences. Our objective was to explore the association between gene polymorphism and ADRs induced by opioid drugs. Evidence-based medical data analysis was conducted for genes related to ADRs induced by opioid drugs to select target genes. Sixty patients with cancer pain who had ADRs after taking opioid drugs (morphine, codeine, oxycodone) and 60 patients without ADRs after taking opioid drugs were used as the experimental group and control group, respectively. Then, we used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or in situ hybridization to detect target genes. By combining with clinical data such as age, sex, dosage and duration of medication, the effect of gene polymorphism on the ADR of patients after taking opioid drugs was statistically analysed. Based on a database search and evidence-based medical data, we identified CYP2D6*10, CYP3A5*3, ABCB1, and OPRM1 as target genes for detection. The results of statistical analysis showed no significant difference in genotype distribution between the experimental group and the control group (p&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.05). However, if 32 patients with ADRs after taking oxycodone and 32 controls were selected for comparison, the SPSS22.0 and SNPStats genetic models showed that the ABCB1 (062rs1045642) CT and TT genotypes correlated with the occurrence of ADRs (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05): the total number of CT&#x2009;+&#x2009;TT genotypes in the experimental group was 29 (90.62%), with 11 (34.37%) CT&#x2009;+&#x2009;TT genotypes types in the control group. Polymorphism of ABCB1 (062rs1045642) is related to ADRs caused by oxycodone, and the incidence of ADRs is higher with the allele T. Polymorphism of ABCB1 is expected to become a clinical predictor of ADRs to oxycodone, and attention should be given to the occurrence of serious ADRs in patients with ABCB1 (062rs1045642) CT and TT genotypes. &#xa9; 2023.

      "abstract": "Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is highly prevalent in Nigeria, with severe pain crises being a primary cause of morbidity. Codeine and tramadol are frequently used opioids, but their effectiveness and safety are significantly influenced by CYP2D6 genetic variations. Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guidelines exist for opioid therapy based on CYP2D6 phenotypes. There's a critical need for pre-emptive pharmacogenomic (PGx) testing in African SCD patients to guide opioid selection. This study aimed to determine CYP2D6 allele, phenotype frequencies and evaluate the feasibility of implementing pre-emptive pharmacogenomic (PGx) testing to guide opioid therapy for SCD patients in Nigeria. This prospective, multicenter implementation study recruited 503 consenting SCD patients (HbSS or HbSC) aged &#x2265;15 years from five Nigerian sites. Blood samples were collected for DNA extraction. CYP2D6 single-nucleotide polymorphisms and copy number variations were determined using Taqman assays based open array, GenoPharm. Phenotypes were assigned based on Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guidelines using the Genomics Information Management System (GIMS). and patient-specific medication safety cards were generated. We successfully genotyped 503 SCD patients with a mean age of 25.1 years, while 61.4% were female, and hydroxyurea use was less than 9.4%. Actionable CYP2D6 variants were found in 36.6% of participants. The predicted phenotype distribution was 8.8% Ultrarapid Metabolizers (UM), 54.1% Normal Metabolizers (NM), 26.0% Intermediate Metabolizers (IM), and 1.8% Poor Metabolizers (PM), with 9.3% undetermined. Patient medication safety cards were provided to guide prescriptions. This study successfully established a genotyped cohort of 503 Nigerian SCD patients, demonstrating the feasibility of pre-emptive pharmacogenetic testing through a Pan-African collaborative model in a resource-limited setting. The identification of PM and UM provides direct clinical guidance, as CPIC guidelines recommend avoiding codeine and tramadol in these groups due to the high risk of diminished efficacy or serious toxicity, respectively. The high prevalence of actionable CYP2D6 variants indicates a substantial proportion of Nigerian SCD patients may experience altered opioid responses, underscoring the need for tailored prescribing to optimise pain control and minimise adverse drug reactions.

      "title": "Opioids in the Brazilian Healthcare Landscape: Crucial Analysis through Anvisa VigiMed Data and Pharmacogenetic Aspects.",
      "abstract": "Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) present a significant challenge to healthcare systems, contributing substantially to hospital admissions. Opioid analgesics are widely used in the pharmacological treatment of various types of pain; however, ADRs represent a major limitation to their use. This study aims to investigate the profile of ADRs reported in Vigimed (the official Brazilian ADR reporting system) following the implementation of active surveillance through pharmacovigilance trackers. Additionally, it evaluates pharmacogenetic evidence to identify genes potentially involved in opioid-related ADRs. This retrospective cross-sectional study analyzed ADR cases reported to Vigimed from January 2018 to April 2023. Data were extracted from Vigimed, tabulated, and subjected to statistical analysis, using the reporting odds ratio (ROR) to assess the strength of associations between opioids and ADRs. During the study period, there were 238,363 ADR reports, of which 6,001 were related to opioid treatment. The distribution among opioids was as follows: 36.7% morphine, 32.4% tramadol, 21.6% fentanyl, 5.4% methadone, 3.7% codeine, and 0.2% oxycodone. The most frequent adverse events associated with opioids were cardiac disorders (ROR 1.70), skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (ROR 2.18), gastrointestinal disorders (ROR 2.88), and nervous system disorders (ROR 1.19). Furthermore, pharmacogenetic evidence indicates that the CYP2D6 gene has a Level 1 association for codeine and tramadol and a Level 2 association for oxycodone. These findings highlight significant associations between specific opioids and ADRs, emphasizing the influence of genetic variations on adverse reactions and the need for personalized medicine in pain management. &#xa9; 2025 The Authors.

Alternative analgesics were recommended for CYP2D6 intermediate or poor metabolizers (IM/PMs). Prescribing decisions were at providers' discretion. The trial randomized 253 participants. A modified intent-to-treat primary analysis assessed change in pain intensity over 3&#x2009;months among IM/PMs (PGx: 49; Standard care: 57). The PGx and standard care arms showed no difference in pain intensity change (-0.10&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.63 vs. -0.21&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.75 standard deviation; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.74) or PGx-aligned care (69% vs. 63%; standardized difference [SD]&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.13). In IM/PMs, secondary analyses of pain intensity change suggested improvements with PGx-aligned (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;70; -0.21&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.70) vs. unaligned care (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;36; -0.06&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.69) (SD&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.22), with this difference increasing when examining IM/PMs with an analgesic change (aligned: n&#x2009;=&#x2009;31, -0.28&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.76; unaligned: n&#x2009;=&#x2009;36, -0.06&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.69; SD&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.31). This approach to PGx implementation for chronic pain was not associated with different prescribing (i.e., similar proportions of PGx-aligned care) or clinical outcomes. Secondary analyses suggest that prescribing aligned with PGx recommendations showed a small improvement in pain intensity. However, the proportion of patients with a clinically meaningful improvement (&#x2265;&#x2009;30%) in pain intensity was similar. Future efforts should identify effective implementation methods. &#xa9; 2025 The Author(s).

      "abstract": "Pharmacotherapy for major depressive disorder (MDD) typically consists of trial-and-error and clinician preference approaches, where patients often fail one or more antidepressants before finding an optimal regimen. Pharmacogenomics (PGx) can assist in prescribing appropriate antidepressants, thereby reducing the time to MDD remission and occurrence of adverse drug events. Since many antidepressants are metabolized by and/or inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes (e.g., CYP2C19 or CYP2D6), drug-induced phenoconversion is common in patients on antidepressant combinations. This condition influences the interpretation of a patient's PGx results, overall risk of ineffective/adverse medication response due to multi-drug interactions, and the recommendations. This complex case describes a patient with MDD, generalized anxiety disorder, and chronic pain who experienced a fall due to excessive sedation following a prescribing cascade of fluoxetine, bupropion, and doxepin. These antidepressants delivered a significant additive sedative effect and interacted with the patient's hydrocodone, potentially contributing to uncontrolled pain, upward dose titration of hydrocodone, and a higher overall sedative burden. The PGx results and drug-induced phenoconversion described in this case report explain the patient's excessive sedation and possibly ineffective/toxic antidepressant and opioid treatment. This case report also illustrates how a more timely multi-drug interaction assessment (preferably in conjunction with preemptive PGx testing) may have informed a different prescribing pattern, reduced/avoided a prescribing cascade, and potentially prevented a drug-related fall.",

Participants included adults prescribed at least 1 CYP2D6-metabolized opioid for more than 7 days between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2022, with whole-genome sequencing data available.

There were no significant differences in ED visits among CYP2D6 genotypic IMs or PMs vs NMs or UMs when testing all 4 drugs together. Among genotypic NMs, ED visits were more frequent among the individuals prescribed CYP2D6 inhibitors (inverse probability-weighted odds ratio, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.32-1.68). In analyses by medication, drug interactions were important for all 4 medications, while genotype associations were significant only for hydrocodone, tramadol, and codeine. In this cohort study, reduced CYP2D6 activity was associated with increased ED visits among individuals treated with CYP2D6-metabolized opioids. This finding suggests that incorporating data on CYP2D6 genotype and accounting for drug interactions in opioid prescribing may improve pain management and reduce ED visits.",

      "title": "Associations between (pharmaco-)genetic markers and postoperative pain after inguinal hernia repair - a prospective study protocol.",
      "abstract": "Postoperative pain is a common complication following surgery, with severity and duration varying between patients. Chronic postoperative pain after inguinal hernia surgery has an incidence rate of approximately 10%. Risk factors for acute and chronic pain following hernia surgery include age, sex, psychosocial factors, and demographic background. Additionally, genetic polymorphisms in enzymes involved in pain mechanisms, as well as the metabolism of analgesics might influence pain perception, pain development, and response to pain medications. Key enzymes include the catechol-o-methyltransferase (COMT), the &#xb5;-opioid receptor 1 (OPRM1), and the cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6). CYP2D6 plays a crucial role in metabolizing analgesics such as tramadol, codeine, and oxycodone. It is also suspected to be involved in the synthesis of catecholamines and endogenous morphines suggesting a potential role in pathophysiology of pain. We hypothesize that the CYP2D6 activity influences the development of postoperative pain after hernia surgery. This study is a prospective, observational, multicenter association study investigating adult patients scheduled for inguinal hernia surgery using a robotic-assisted (rTAPP) approach. Patients are enrolled during the preoperative surgical consultation. A buccal swab is collected for genetic testing at this time. Pain at the site of the hernia is assessed using the validated EuraHSQoL score preoperatively and at 2, 4, and 6&#xa0;weeks postoperatively. Additionally, information on co-medication and details of the surgery will be collected. The planned number of participants is 350 patients. The primary objective is to analyze the association between different genotype-predicted CYP2D6 phenotypes and patient-reported pain intensity 6&#xa0;weeks after surgery. Secondary objectives include the association between further genetic variants, such as the COMT rs4680 and OPRM1 rs1799971 genotype, and pain severity. Additionally, the potential of pharmacogenetic panel testing to optimize analgesic therapy in hernia surgery patients will be explored. The findings of this study are expected to provide valuable insights into identifying patients at higher risk for postoperative pain before surgery. This knowledge could pave the way for tailored interventions during and after surgery for these specific patients.

      "abstract": "Hydrocodone, tramadol, codeine, and oxycodone are commonly prescribed opioids that rely on activation by cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6). CYP2D6 inhibitors can significantly decrease CYP2D6 activity, leading to reduced generation of active metabolites, and impairing pain control. To understand this impact, we assessed emergency department (ED) visits in patients initiating these CYP2D6-dependent opioids while on CYP2D6-inhibitor antidepressants vs. antidepressants that do not inhibit CYP2D6. This retrospective cohort study included adult patients prescribed CYP2D6-dependent opioids utilizing electronic health records data from the University of Florida Health (2015-2021). The association between ED visits and inhibitor exposure was tested using multivariable logistic regression. The primary analysis had 12,118 patients (72% female; mean (SD) age, 55 (13.4)) in the hydrocodone/tramadol/codeine cohort and 5,547 patients (64% female; mean (SD) age, 53.6 (14.2)) in the oxycodone cohort. Hydrocodone/tramadol/codeine-treated patients exposed to CYP2D6-inhibitor antidepressants (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;7,043) had a higher crude rate of pain-related ED visits than those taking other antidepressants (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;5,075) (3.28% vs. 1.87%), with an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 1.75 (95% CI: 1.36 to 2.24). Similarly, in the oxycodone cohort, CYP2D6-inhibitor antidepressant-exposed individuals (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;3,206) had a higher crude rate of ED visits than individuals exposed to other antidepressants (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;2,341) (5.02% vs. 3.37%), with aOR of 1.70 (95% CI: 1.27-2.27). Similar findings were observed in secondary and sensitivity analyses. Our findings suggest patients with concomitant use of hydrocodone/tramadol/codeine or oxycodone and CYP2D6 inhibitors have more frequent ED visits for pain, which may be due to inadequate pain control. &#xa9; 2024 The Author(s).

      "abstract": "Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes are important regulators of drug efficacy and toxicity. Genetic variation in CYP isoforms can impact how well patients respond to medications or experience unwanted toxicities. PharmGKB is an online pharmacogenomics resource that collates the latest data and clinical guidelines on genetic variation and drug responses. The purpose of this lesson was to develop an interactive, case-based activity that demonstrated how pharmacogenetics can be used to influence the prescribing of medications. This lesson was provided to 71 students during a two-hour online interactive session. The lesson consisted of 1) a didactic lecture on pharmacogenetic principles, 2) an overview of the PharmGKB website by the instructor, and 3) patient cases that used the PharmGKB website to answer questions and make recommendations about drug therapy. Patient cases explored the impact of genetic variation in CYP enzymes on patients prescribed medications for different diseases including depression (citalopram, CYP2C19), pain (codeine, CYP2D6), organ transplantation (tacrolimus, CYP3A5), and viral infection (efavirenz, CYP2B6). Four additional cases are included in this lesson. Students reviewed the patient cases in small groups, used PharmGKB to answer questions and design treatment plans, and presented their recommendations to instructors and other students. Based on pre-/post-lesson assessment questions and student feedback, we conclude that an interactive, group-based activity can be used to teach basic principles of pharmacogenetics and connect students to online resources for drug dosing.",

      "title": "Enzalutamide Reduces Oxycodone Exposure in Men with Prostate Cancer.",
      "abstract": "Up to 90% of patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) will develop symptomatic bone metastases requiring pain medication, with opioids being the mainstay of therapy in treating moderate and severe pain. Enzalutamide is an androgen receptor antagonist for the treatment of CRPC and a strong inducer of cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A4. Hereby, enzalutamide potentially reduces the exposure of oxycodone, an opioid metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Our objective was to evaluate the potential drug-drug interaction of enzalutamide and oxycodone. A prospective, nonrandomized, open-label, two-arm parallel study was performed. All patients received a single dose of 15&#xa0;mg normal-release oxycodone. Patients in the enzalutamide arm (ENZ-arm) received enzalutamide 160&#xa0;mg once daily. Plasma concentrations of oxycodone and its metabolites were quantified using a validated liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method. Twenty-six patients (13 ENZ-arm; 13 control arm) were enrolled in the study. Enzalutamide decreased the mean AUC 0-8&#xa0;h and C max of oxycodone with, respectively, 44.7% (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) and 35.5% (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.004) compared with the control arm. The AUC 0-8&#xa0;h and C max of the active metabolite oxymorphone were 74.2% (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) and 56.0% (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001) lower in the ENZ-arm compared with the control arm. In contrast, AUC 0-8&#xa0;h and C max of the inactive metabolites noroxycodone and noroxymorphone were significantly increased by enzalutamide. Co-administration of enzalutamide significantly reduced exposure to oxycodone and its active metabolite oxymorphone in men with prostate cancer. This should be taken into account when prescribing enzalutamide combined with oxycodone. &#xa9; 2023. The Author(s).",

      "abstract": "In clinical practice, family medication history is not routinely assessed as part of a patient's family health history (FHH). The information is self-reported and can depend on the individual's subjective perception. To illustrate how pharmacogenetic (PGx) testing results could be used to validate self-reported family medication history on drug-related problems (DRP), as well as to inform medication-related decisions, we herein present a case involving ten members of the same family. Prior to a planned surgery, a preemptive PGx panel test was performed for a nine-year-old girl due to self-reported family medication history. The PGx panel test was also performed for her three siblings, parents, and grandparents. The focus was directed to the paternal grandmother, as she reported DRP from the hypnotic agent propofol, and to the maternal grandmother, as she described DRP after the administration of codeine and tramadol. A commercial PGx panel test of 100 variations in 30 different genes was conducted and analyzed focusing on genetic variants in cytochrome P450 enzyme 2B6 (CYP2B6), and CYP2D6 as they are involved in the biotransformation of propofol and the bioactivation of codeine and tramadol, respectively. The girl was identified as (1) CYP2B6 intermediate metabolizer (IM) with reduced enzyme activity and (2) CYP2D6 poor metabolizer (PM) with no enzyme activity. Regarding the planned surgery, it was recommended (1) to carefully titrate propofol dosage with increased monitoring of potential DRP and (2) to avoid opioids whose activation is mediated by CYP2D6 (e.g. codeine and tramadol). Further PGx testing revealed (1) the paternal grandmother as CYP2B6 normal metabolizer (NM) and (2) the maternal grandmother as CYP2D6 NM. The original trigger for PGx testing was the self-reported, conspicuous family medication history of DRP reported by the grandmothers. However, the girl's genotype predicted phenotypes of CYP2B6 IM and CYP2D6 PM, differed from the grandmothers'. With this exemplary case, we propose that hereditary concerns based on self-reported information on DRP should be verified by a PGx panel test, when the respective drug exhibits a PGx association. Also, the girl's PGx testing results provided important medication recommendations, which were considered perioperatively by the anesthetist suggesting to use PGx testing results preemptively to inform medication-related decisions. &#xa9; 2024.

These products are linked to breathing problems among ultra-rapid CYP2D6 metabolizers and early use of opioid can lead to future opioid misuse. Using a multi-province population-based cohort study, we estimate the impact of federal safety alerts on annual rates of codeine use in the Canadian pediatric population. We analyzed data from 8,156,948 children/adolescents in five Canadian provinces between 1996 and 2021, using a common protocol. Children/adolescents were categorized as:&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;12&#xa0;years (children) or&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;12&#xa0;years (adolescents). We defined codeine exposure by&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;1 prescription filled for codeine alone or combined with other medications. For both age categories, we obtained province-specific codeine prescription filling rates per calendar year by dividing the number of children/adolescents with&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;1 codeine prescription filled by the number of person-time. Annual rates of codeine use per 1000 persons vary by province from 3.0 (Quebec) to 10.1 (Manitoba) in children, and from 5.5 to 51.3 in adolescents.

However, tramadol's pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics are influenced by cytochrome P450 (CYP)2D6 activity, similarly to codeine. Previous studies in adults have demonstrated a correlation between pupillary response and tramadol PK. Our objective was to evaluate pupillometry as a phenotyping method to assess CYP2D6 activity in children treated with tramadol. We included 41 children (mean age 11 years) receiving a first dose of tramadol (2 mg/kg) in the emergency room (ER) as part of their routine care. CYP2D6 phenotyping and genotyping were performed. The concentrations of tramadol and its active metabolite, M1, were measured, and static and dynamic pupillometry was conducted using a handheld pupillometer at the time of tramadol administration and during the ER stay. Pupillometric measurements were obtained for 37 children. Tramadol affected pupillary parameters, with a decrease in pupil diameter in 83.8% of children ( p = 0.002) (mean decrease 14.1 &#xb1; 16.7%) and a decrease in reflex amplitude constriction in 78.4% ( p = 0.011) (mean decrease 17.7 &#xb1; 34.5%) at T150 compared to T0.

Materials &amp; methods: The authors conducted a cross-sectional study to determine the effect of CYP2D6 and UGT2B7 polymorphisms on pain management in 106 Zimbabwean SCD patients. Participant information was collected on a questionnaire. Genotyping was conducted using the GenoPharm &#xae; pharmacogenomics open array panel containing CYP2D6 and UGT genetic variants implicated in opioid response. Results: The reduced function alleles CYP2D6*17 and *29 had high frequencies of 15.9% and 12.9%, respectively. UGT2B7 rs73823859 showed a statistically significant correlation with pain levels (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.0454). Conclusion: This study demonstrated the role of UGT2B7 polymorphism in SCD patient pain management.",

      "title": "Does cytochrome 2D6 genotype affect the analgesic efficacy of codeine after ambulatory surgery? Prospective trial in 987 adults.",
      "abstract": "Paracetamol-codeine combination tablet is widely used in pain management after day surgery. For safety reasons, its use has decreased in recent years. Codeine is a prodrug metabolised in the liver by the cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) enzyme to morphine that produces the analgesic effect of codeine. CYP2D6 is highly polymorphic, and based on genotypes, individuals can be divided into four categories: poor-, intermediate-, normal- and ultrarapid metabolisers. Differences in morphine and its metabolite concentrations have been described between different CYP2D6 genotypes following codeine administration. The aim of the study was to investigate the possible effect of CYP2D6 genotype on codeine efficacy and adverse effects in a large cohort of adult patients undergoing ambulatory surgery. A total of 987 patients scheduled for ambulatory surgery were included in the analyses. Operation types or anaesthesia methods were not limited in the study protocol. All study patients received a fixed dose of paracetamol (1000&#x2009;mg) and codeine (60&#x2009;mg) orally for premedication. A blood sample was drawn to identify the genotype of CYP2D6. At home, the first-line analgesic was paracetamol-codeine combination of 1-2 tablets at 1-3 times per day. Data on the efficacy and side effects of codeine were collected on the day of surgery and the following two postoperative days. Of the studied patients, 37 (3.7%) were poor CYP2D6 metabolisers, 264 (27%) were intermediate, 623 (63%) were normal and 63 (6.4%) were ultrarapid metabolisers. Activity scores ranged from 0 to 4. CYP2D6 genotype was not associated in a statistically significant manner with postoperative pain, opioid consumption or the adverse effects of codeine, except for constipation at home. Poor CYP2D6 metabolisers reported significantly less severe constipation compared with normal metabolisers (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.009, OR 0.40, 95% Cl 0.20-0.80). CYP2D6 genotype appears to be of minor importance for the analgesic efficacy of oral paracetamol-codeine combination therapy after ambulatory surgery in adult patients undergoing similar types of surgery as in the present study but it may affect the risk of constipation. &#xa9; 2024 The Author(s).

      "title": "Evaluation of the impact of CYP2D6 testing on outcomes in patients taking opioids.",
      "abstract": "CYP2D6 affects metabolism of several opioids; however, the clinical impact of genetic variants on efficacy has limited evidence in large patient populations. This study aims to assess the impact of CYP2D6 phenotype on pain response in an elective pharmacogenomics (PGx) screening population prescribed opioids. A retrospective review was conducted on hospitalized patients with CYP2D6 genotyping, prescribed either codeine, tramadol, hydrocodone, or oxycodone within 24 months prior to PGx testing and through 36 months after results. Pain scores were abstracted on a 10-point analog scale and categorized into 3 cohorts (mild, moderate, and severe) based on their baseline pain score. Baseline pain score was measured within 30 min of each opioid dose administration. Percentage changes in pain scores from baseline to 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours following each respective opioid dose administration were analyzed. Morphine milligram equivalents (MME) were averaged amongst the days of opioid administration. A total of 8062 patients were analyzed. Oxycodone was the most administered (4856, 41%). Mild pain cohort poor metabolizers (PMs) had significant increase in pain scores compared to normal metabolizers (NMs) at all hours from baseline (P &lt; 0.001). PMs in moderate and severe pain cohorts had significantly decreased pain score reduction than NMs at all hours from baseline (P &lt; 0.001). PMs had significantly higher MME compared to NMs in these cohorts (15 vs. 10, P &lt; 0.001). CYP2D6 PMs had significantly less pain score reduction. CYP2D6 genotyping can lead to effective use of opioids in pain management and may display greater impact on efficacy of oxycodone than previously studied. Full implication of PGx testing is limited by the study's retrospective nature. PMs across all pain intensity cohorts had significantly less reduction in pain scores from baseline compared to NMs (P &lt; 0.05). These results encourage further investigation into prospective pre-emptive CYP2D6 testing regarding effective pain management by optimizing opioid administration.

      "abstract": "To explore pain outcomes in patients prescribed hydrocodone and psychotropic medications with or without CYP2D6 inhibition activity. Patients hospitalized for lower/limited upper extremity injuries who were prescribed hydrocodone alongside a psychotropic medication were considered for this study (n=224). A subset of these patients (n=178) was prescribed a psychotropic medication known to inhibit CYP2D6, while the remainder (n=46) were prescribed psychotropic medications without CYP2D6 inhibition activity. Patient demographics and pain outcomes were collected by electronic health record review and interviews. Patients taking a psychotropic inhibitor of CYP2D6 exhibited longer duration of opioid use post-discharge (median 33&#xa0;days [IQR 10-99]) compared with patients taking a psychotropic non-inhibitor (4&#xa0;days [2-20], p&lt;0.001). No significant differences were observed with in-hospital pain outcomes, including total dose of hydrocodone administered, duration of hydrocodone use, pain index scores, and the occurrence of common mild/moderate/severe hydrocodone side effects. Patients prescribed at least one psychotropic inhibitor of CYP2D6 were more likely to continue using hydrocodone for up to 3&#xa0;months following surgery. Knowledge of these critical drug-drug interactions could enhance clinical practice and improve patient outcomes. This study highlights negative post-operative pain outcomes in patients prescribed hydrocodone alongside a psychotropic inhibitor of CYP2D6. The results of this study indicate that patients taking psychotropic medications that inhibit CYP2D6 are at increased risk for prolonged hydrocodone use following orthopedic surgery. &#xa9; 2024 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.",

      "title": "Chronic Pain Management in a CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizer: A Case Report for Oxycodone.",
      "abstract": "The objective of this case report is to illustrate pharmacogenomics (PGx)-guided oxycodone treatment, given the conflicting data on the analgesic response from oxycodone in Cytochrome P450 (CYP)2D6 poor metabolizers (PMs). PGx-guided therapy can help improve treatment outcomes. This case report describes a 58-year-old patient who was prescribed oxycodone for chronic pain management. The patient presented with a history of inadequate pain control despite analgesic treatment with oxycodone (morphine milliequivalent [MME] = 22.5). Pharmacogenetic testing revealed that the patient was a CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizer (PM), which may shed light on the observed lack of analgesic response to oxycodone. The clinical pharmacist recommended switching to an alternative opioid not metabolized via the CYP2D6 pathway. The patient was subsequently switched to hydromorphone (MME = 16), resulting in improved pain control and fewer side effects. The newer hydromorphone dose accounted for a 30% MME dose reduction. The patient's initial average and worst pain score were 7 and 9 out of 10, respectively, per the numeric rating scale (NRS). Upon follow-up with the patient in two weeks, her average and worst pain scores improved to 3 and 3.5 out of 10, respectively, per the NRS. Further PGx testing results led to an overall positive outcome, such as her willingness to participate in physical therapy as a result of improved pain scores. This case highlights the importance of considering individual variability in drug metabolism when prescribing medications, particularly opioids such as oxycodone, to ensure optimal therapeutic outcomes and minimize the risk of adverse events in CYP2D6 PMs.",

      "title": "CYP2D6 inhibition by diphenhydramine leading to fatal hydrocodone overdose.",
      "abstract": "Fatal drug overdoses often involve multiple co-intoxicants, including opioids. Hydrocodone, the most prescribed opioid for pain management, is metabolized to the active metabolite hydromorphone by hepatic CYP2D6. Inhibition of CYP2D6 by other compounds can disrupt the analgesic properties of hydrocodone and extend its half-life. Diphenhydramine is an over-the-counter cold medication and is known to inhibit CYP2D6 activity. A woman in her late 50s was prescribed hydrocodone/acetaminophen (Norco &#xae; 10/325). Days before her death, she began taking diphenhydramine for cold symptoms. A post-mortem toxicology report detected the following compounds by High Performance Liquid Chromatography/Time of Flight-Mass Spectrometry (LC/TOF-MS) analysis: acetaminophen (14&#x202f;&#x3bc;g/mL), hydrocodone (410&#x202f;ng/mL), dihydrocodeine (24&#x202f;ng/mL), and diphenhydramine (150&#x202f;ng/mL). Hydromorphone was not detected (&lt;2&#x202f;ng/mL). All compounds were detected in therapeutic concentrations, except for hydrocodone, which was present at lethal concentrations. This case highlights a fatal drug-drug interaction between hydrocodone and diphenhydramine. The estimated total body burden of hydrocodone was 6- to 12-fold higher than acetaminophen, which is unexpected, as these two drugs were administered as a single formulation and have similar half-lives. Furthermore, hydromorphone was undetectable. Taken together, these findings are highly suggestive of a fatal opioid overdose precipitated by diphenhydramine. &#xa9; 2024 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.",
