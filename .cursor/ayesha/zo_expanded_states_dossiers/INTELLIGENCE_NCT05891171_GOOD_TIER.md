## 🎯 WHY THIS TRIAL IS A GOOD FIT FOR AYESHA (LLM Analysis)

### **Clinical Trial Analysis: NCT05891171**

**Note**: This is a structured fallback analysis (LLM unavailable).

#### **1. Drug Mechanism Fit**
The trial "Study of AB598 Monotherapy and Combination Therapy in Participants With Advanced Cancers" requires detailed mechanism analysis. Review the trial protocol to understand how the investigational drug addresses Ayesha's Stage IVB High-Grade Serous Ovarian Carcinoma with extensive tumor burden and pleural metastases.

#### **2. Location Logistics**
Review trial locations to identify NYC metro sites accessible from ZIP 10029 (East Harlem). Preferred centers: Mount Sinai (local), MSK (2 miles), NYU Langone (3-4 miles).

#### **3. Risk-Benefit for Ayesha**
**Key Considerations**:
- Pulmonary compromise: Large bilateral pleural effusions require careful monitoring
- ECOG 1: Acceptable for most trials, but toxicity profile is critical
- Tumor burden: Extensive disease (CA-125 >2800) may require aggressive initial treatment

#### **4. Comparison to Standard of Care**
Ayesha's planned SOC is Carboplatin + Paclitaxel + Bevacizumab (NCCN-guideline first-line therapy for Stage IVB HGSOC, BRCA wildtype). This trial should be compared to this regimen to assess:
- Is it a replacement for SOC (frontline trial)?
- Is it additional to SOC (maintenance trial)?
- Is it an alternative if SOC fails?

#### **5. Critical Considerations**
1. **Biomarker testing**: HER2 and HRD status are unknown - may be required for enrollment
2. **Timing**: When should Ayesha enroll? Before SOC, during SOC, or after response?
3. **Clinical team review**: Discuss with Ayesha's oncologist before enrollment decisions

**Recommendation**: Full protocol review with clinical team required.

## 📋 FULL ELIGIBILITY TEXT

### Eligibility Criteria
Key Inclusion Criteria:

* Must have at least 1 measurable lesion per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidance
* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of 0 or 1
* Prior systemic radiation or whole brain radiation therapy must have been completed at least 4 weeks before investigational product (IP) administration. Other palliative radiotherapy must be completed 2 weeks before investigational product administration, if radiation therapy-related AEs have resolved to Grade ≤ 1.
* Monotherapy-specific criteria for dose escalation and PD cohorts:

  * Dose Escalation: Participants may have any pathologically confirmed advanced or metastatic solid tumor for which standard therapy has proven ineffective, intolerable, or is considered inappropriate.
  * Pharmacodynamic Cohorts: Participants may have any pathologically confirmed advanced or metastatic solid tumors for which standard therapy has proven ineffective, intolerable, or is considered inappropriate. Participants must be able to undergo collection of a fresh frozen biopsy during screening, as well as provide an on-treatment fresh frozen biopsy.
* Dose Expansion cohort criteria:

  * Histologically confirmed, documented diagnosis of HER2-negative locally advanced unresectable or metastatic gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma.
  * No prior systemic treatment for locally advanced unresectable or metastatic disease.
  * Cannot have progressed within 6 months of prior platinum-based chemotherapy for earlier stage disease.

Key Exclusion Criteria:

* Use of any live vaccines against infectious diseases (eg, influenza, varicella) within 4 weeks (28 days) of initiation of study
* Underlying medical conditions or AEs that, in the investigator or sponsor's opinion, will make the administration of the study drugs hazardous
* Any active or documented history of autoimmune disease including but not limited to inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, Wegner syndrome, Hashimoto syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, sarcoidosis, or autoimmune hepatitis, within 3 years of the first dose of study treatment
* History of trauma or major surgery within 28 days prior to the first dose of study drug
* Treatment with systemic immunosuppressive medication within 2 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment, or anticipation of need for systemic immunosuppressant medication during study treatment with certain protocol specified exceptions

Note: Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply.

## 📊 TRIAL DESCRIPTION

The primary purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of AB598 in participants with advanced malignancies.

## 🏥 LOCATION DETAILS

### NYC Metro Locations (Priority for Ayesha)

1. **Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey** - New Brunswick, New Jersey

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL GATES FOR AYESHA

### HER2 Testing (Priority: P0 - URGENT)
**Status**: PENDING  
**Test**: HER2 IHC (ASCO-CAP gastric scoring)  
**Turnaround**: 3-5 days  
**Cost**: $200-400  
**Rationale**: HER2 status unknown - testing required. If IHC 1+/2+ (expression, not amplification), Ayesha may be eligible for breakthrough T-DXd trial.


---

## ⚔️ TACTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS

**Priority**: ⚠️ **P1 - HIGH PRIORITY** (Eligibility: ~50%)

**Next Steps**:
1. **Review eligibility carefully** (with oncologist)
2. **Order pending biomarker tests** (if required)
3. **Contact trial site** (within 1 week)
4. **Backup option** (if top-tier trials fail)


---

## 🎯 VALUE PROPOSITION

**WIN-WIN SCENARIO**:
- If eligible (50% chance) → Access to experimental therapy
- If not eligible → Gets proven SOC (PARP or bevacizumab maintenance)
- Either way, Ayesha receives appropriate care

**Risk-Benefit**: Low risk (pre-screening doesn't commit to enrollment), high reward (cutting-edge therapy)
