I can see you're having issues with the SpecStory import script. The error indicates that the conversation wasn't found in the backup, which suggests the script might be looking in the wrong location or the backup doesn't contain the expected data.

Let me examine the script and the Python restoration script to understand what's happening:

---

<tool-use data-tool-type="read" data-tool-name="read_file">
<details><summary>Tool use: **read_file** • Read file: IMPORT_SPECSTORY_CHAT.sh</summary>

</details>
</tool-use>

---

<tool-use data-tool-type="read" data-tool-name="read_file">
<details><summary>Tool use: **read_file** • Read file: restore_specstory_conversation.py</summary>

</details>
</tool-use>

I can see the issue! The problem is that the Python script is looking for the database in the wrong table. Let me examine the database structure to understand the correct format.

Let me check what the actual database structure looks like:

---

Model provided invalid arguments to terminal tool.

---

<tool-use data-tool-type="unknown" data-tool-name="run_terminal_cmd">
<details>
<summary>Tool use: **run_terminal_cmd**</summary>

Status: **loading**


</details>
</tool-use>
