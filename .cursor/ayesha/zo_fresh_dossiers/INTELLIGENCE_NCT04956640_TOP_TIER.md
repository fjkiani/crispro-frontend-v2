## 🎯 WHY THIS TRIAL IS A GOOD FIT FOR AYESHA (LLM Analysis)

### **Clinical Analysis for AK (40F, HGSOC)**
**Trial:** NCT04956640 (LY3537982, KRAS G12C Inhibitor)
**Date of Analysis:** October 26, 2023

This analysis evaluates the suitability of trial NCT04956640 for Ms. Kiani, a 40-year-old woman with newly diagnosed, extensive Stage IVB high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC).

---

#### **1. Drug Mechanism Fit: POOR**

The fundamental mismatch for Ms. Kiani is the trial's target mutation. LY3537982 is a highly specific inhibitor of the KRAS G12C mutation. This is a "lock-and-key" therapy; if the "lock" (the KRAS G12C mutation) is not present, the "key" (the drug) will have no therapeutic effect.

*   **Mutation Rarity:** KRAS mutations are infrequent in HGSOC, occurring in only about 2-5% of cases. The specific G12C variant is even rarer. Without confirmation from next-generation sequencing (NGS) of her tumor tissue or ctDNA, it is statistically improbable that she harbors this mutation. Her current biomarker profile (BRCA wildtype, HRD unknown) provides no information about her KRAS status.
*   **Disease Biology:** HGSOC is typically driven by TP53 mutations and widespread genomic instability (often reflected in HRD status), not KRAS activation. The trial intervention does not address the primary known biological drivers of her cancer.

**Conclusion:** The trial is only relevant if molecular testing definitively confirms a KRAS G12C mutation. Lacking this result, the biological rationale for her participation is non-existent.

#### **2. Location Logistics: EXCELLENT (Manhattan Sites)**

The trial's accessibility within New York City is a significant advantage.

*   **Memorial Sloan Kettering (MSKCC):** Located on the Upper East Side, this is a short taxi or bus ride from her East Harlem (10029) residence, likely taking 15-30 minutes.
*   **NYU Langone (Main Campus):** Located in Kips Bay, this is also highly accessible via public transit or taxi, with an estimated travel time of 20-40 minutes.
*   **NYU Langone-Long Island (Mineola):** This site is logistically prohibitive. It would require a multi-modal commute of over 1.5 hours each way, which is an unreasonable burden for a patient with an ECOG 1 status and significant disease-related symptoms.

The availability at MSK and NYU, two premier cancer centers, aligns perfectly with her location.

#### **3. Risk-Benefit Analysis: HIGH RISK, UNCERTAIN BENEFIT**

Given Ms. Kiani's clinical status, the risk-benefit profile is unfavorable.

*   **Risks:** Her compromised pulmonary status from large bilateral effusions is a major concern. While her ECOG is 1, her respiratory reserve is low. A key risk with many targeted therapies, including some KRAS inhibitors, is drug-induced pneumonitis. Even a mild case could precipitate a severe respiratory crisis for her. Furthermore, as a Phase I/II study, the full toxicity profile of LY3537982 is not yet established.
*   **Benefit:** The potential benefit—a durable response to a targeted oral agent—is entirely contingent on the presence of the KRAS G12C mutation. If she is mutation-negative, she would be exposed to the risks of an experimental drug with zero chance of benefit, while critically delaying effective therapy.

#### **4. Comparison to Standard of Care: SOC IS SUPERIOR**

The proposed Standard of Care (SOC) is unequivocally the superior and appropriate first-line strategy for Ms. Kiani.

*   **SOC (Carboplatin/Paclitaxel/Bevacizumab):** This is a highly effective, evidence-based regimen with a high probability of inducing a significant response. It is the global standard for advanced HGSOC. Critically, bevacizumab is known to be effective in controlling malignant pleural effusions and ascites, directly addressing her most life-limiting symptom.
*   **Trial:** The trial would involve replacing this proven, multi-agent regimen with an experimental monotherapy of unknown efficacy in first-line HGSOC. The trial's own description suggests it is primarily for patients who have already progressed on standard therapy. Pursuing this trial first-line would be a significant deviation from evidence-based practice.

#### **5. Critical Considerations for the Care Team**

1.  **Prioritize Urgent Molecular Testing:** The most critical first step is to obtain comprehensive genomic profiling (NGS) and determine her HRD status. **HRD status is far more clinically relevant than KRAS status.** If she is HRD-positive, she becomes a candidate for a first-line PARP inhibitor, which is a proven, practice-changing therapy for HGSOC.
2.  **Do Not Delay SOC:** Ms. Kiani has extensive, symptomatic disease. She requires prompt initiation of systemic therapy to gain control of her cancer and alleviate her respiratory compromise. Delaying treatment for trial screening or awaiting NGS results that have a low probability of being relevant (i.e., KRAS G12C) would be clinically inappropriate.
3.  **Clarify Trial Cohort Eligibility:** The care team must confirm with the study Principal Investigator (PI) whether a treatment-naive HGSOC cohort even exists within this trial. It is highly likely that enrollment is restricted to relapsed/refractory patients.

**Final Recommendation:** **This trial is not a good fit for Ms. Kiani at this time.** The immediate priority should be initiating the planned SOC (Carboplatin/Paclitaxel/Bevacizumab) to manage her high tumor burden and symptomatic pleural effusions. Concurrently, her tumor should be tested for HRD status to guide future maintenance therapy decisions. The search for a KRAS G12C mutation is a very low-yield investigation and should not delay standard, life-prolonging treatment.

* Patients must have disease with evidence of KRAS G12C mutation in tumor tissue or circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).
* Participants must have a histological or a cytologically proven diagnosis of locally advanced, unresectable, and/or metastatic cancer and meet cohort-specific criteria.

For untreated patients in the arm with LY3537982 in combination with pembrolizumab noted above, a single cycle of pembrolizumab may be initiated within 21 days prior to enrollment. For untreated patients in the arm of LY3537982 in combination with pembrolizumab, pemetrexed, and platinum therapy, a single cycle of any or all of the drugs other than LY3537982 may be initiated within 21 days prior to enrollment. Start of study treatment may be delayed to allow sufficient time for recovery from treatment-related toxicity.
* For one part of the study, participants must have received at least one prior oxaliplatin- or irinotecan-containing regimen for advanced or metastatic CRC. * Disease suitable for local therapy administered with curative intent.

Patients with treated CNS metastases are eligible for this study if their disease is asymptomatic, radiographically stable for at least 30 days, and they do not require treatment with steroids in the two-week period prior to study treatment. Patients with active CNS metastases are eligible for one part of the study.
* Have received prior treatment with any KRAS G12C small molecule inhibitor, except in certain scenarios where such prior therapy is allowed as per protocol.
* The following patients will be excluded from some parts of the study:

  * Experienced certain serious side effects with prior immunotherapy.
