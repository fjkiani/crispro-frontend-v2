      "title": "NUDT15 Pharmacogenetics in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia: Synthesizing Progress for Personalized Thiopurine Therapy.",
      "abstract": "The management of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the most common pediatric malignancy, critically relies on thiopurine therapy, such as 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), during the maintenance phase. However, significant inter-individual response variety and high risk of myelosuppression often disrupt therapy efficacy. Pharmacogenetics offer crucial strategies to personalized therapy. While thiopurine methyltransferase ( TPMT ) was initially the primary focus, the discovery of nudix hydrolase 15 ( NUDT15 ) appears as a more comprehensive determinant of thiopurine intolerance. This review aims to consolidate and critically evaluate the advancement achieved in unraveling the biological mechanism and clinical significance of NUDT15 pharmacogenetics in thiopurine therapy. Foundational studies showed the vital role of NUDT15 in the detoxification of active thiopurines, with common genetic variants (for instance, p. Arg139Cys) significantly disrupting its activity, leading to the accumulation of toxic metabolites. Observational studies consistently associated NUDT15 variants with severe myelosuppression, notably in Asian populations. Recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) confirmed that NUDT15 genotype-guided dosing effectively reduces thiopurine-induced toxicity without interfering with the therapeutic outcome. Despite these advancements, challenges remain present, including the incomplete characterization of rare variants, limited data in the diverse Asian populations, and the need for standardized integration with metabolite monitoring. In conclusion, NUDT15 pharmacogenetics is essential for improving patient safety and thiopurine dosage optimization in the treatment of ALL. For thiopurine tailored medicine to be widely and fairly implemented, future research should focus on increasing genetic data across different populations, improving the dose adjustment algorithm, and harmonizing therapeutic guidelines.",

      "abstract": "Cronkhite-Canada syndrome (CCS) is a rare non-hereditary chronic inflammatory disease characteristic of gastrointestinal polyps and ectodermal abnormalities. Corticosteroid therapy is the mainstay medication for CCS. Few studies indicated immunosuppressants might be the choices for patients with steroid refractory, steroid dependent or intolerant. To examine the efficacy and safety of azathioprine (AZA) in CCS patients. We retrospectively reviewed the records of 12 CCS patients treated with azathioprine between July 2014 and October 2023 and the clinical data including demographic characteristics, treatment regimen and adverse events were subsequently collected and analyzed. The genetic variants of TPMT and NUDT15 genes were also retrospectively assessed using sanger sequencing in 11 patients. All patients were in active stage at baseline and 9 patients (75%) were in combination with corticosteroid. On account of the indication, 6 patients were steroid dependent or intolerant and another 6 patients needed augmentation therapy. The target dose of AZA was 1.0 to 1.5&#xa0;mg/kg per day. Ten (83.3%) patients achieved clinical response, of whom 3 cases had endoscopic remission and 5 cases had endoscopic improvement respectively. Three (25%) patients suffered from pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, liver dysfunction and leukopenia, respectively, resulting in cessation of AZA in the initial 3 months. Four heterozygous missense variants of TPMT and NUDT15 were identified in four patients. One patient who had TPMT*6 and took AZA with the dose of 2.04&#xa0;mg/kg per day suffered from severe leukopenia. Azathioprine might be a good alternative medication in CCS patients who are steroid dependent or intolerant, or need augmentation therapy. The adverse events should be closely monitored especially myelosuppression and the tests of TPMT and NUDT15 genotypes before therapy may be helpful for medication guidance. &#xa9; 2024.

      "title": "Validation of diagnostic screening test for pharmacogenomic targets for thiopurine drugs in indian pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients.",
      "abstract": "Thiopurines such as 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) are central to maintenance therapy for pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), yet their narrow therapeutic index frequently causes dose-limiting myelosuppression in genetically susceptible patients. Variants in NUDT15 and TPMT are major pharmacogenetic determinants of thiopurine intolerance, particularly in Asian populations. Despite CPIC recommendations for pre-emptive genotyping, routine pharmacogenetic testing is seldom implemented in India due to high costs and limited access to sequencing-based platforms. To develop, standardize, and validate a rapid, low-cost tetra-primer ARMS-PCR assay for simultaneous detection of the most clinically relevant variants- NUDT15 c.415C&gt;T and TPMT 3C (c.719A&gt;G)-prioritized through comprehensive in silico analysis. Missense SNPs in NUDT15 and TPMT were screened using SIFT, PolyPhen-2, PROVEAN, Meta-SNP, and SNPs&amp;GO to identify high-impact variants. A multiplex ARMS-PCR assay was optimized and applied to 61 pediatric ALL samples. Genotyping results were validated by Sanger sequencing. Clinical correlations included hematologic toxicity, 6-MP dose intensity, and blast-percentage dynamics. In-silico prioritization consistently identified NUDT15 c.415C&gt;T and TPMT 3C as the most deleterious and clinically actionable variants. Among 60 successfully genotyped patients, NUDT15 variants were detected in 16.7% (9&#xa0;C/T and 1&#xa0;T/T), while TPMT 3C heterozygosity was observed in 3.3%; no double-mutants were identified. ARMS-PCR showed 98.4% overall diagnostic accuracy relative to Sanger sequencing (sensitivity 90.9%, specificity 100%). NUDT15 -variant carriers exhibited significantly reduced 6-MP dose intensity (median 0.50 vs. 0.79; p &lt; 0.0001). Blast-percentage analysis demonstrated marked reduction from baseline to follow-up (median 75%-15%; p = 0.0001), consistent with expected treatment response. The validated ARMS-PCR assay provides a reliable, rapid, and cost-effective platform for simultaneous NUDT15 and TPMT 3C genotyping, demonstrating strong concordance with sequencing and clear clinical relevance. Its affordability and minimal infrastructure requirements make it suitable for integration into routine pre-treatment workflows in India, enabling genotype-guided thiopurine dosing and reducing the risk of treatment-related toxicity. This assay supports a scalable path toward equitable implementation of pharmacogenomics in resource-limited pediatric oncology settings.

      "abstract": "Thiopurines are employed in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs; Crohn's disease, CD; ulcerative colitis, UC) to induce remission, prevent relapse, and reduce the steroid dosage, although they can sometimes be ineffective and present side effects. Genetic variations in the TPMT and NUDT15 genes are well recognized to influence the therapeutic response, despite notable regional differences in their frequencies across various ethnic populations. Herein, the risk haplotypes TPMT*3A, *3B, *3C, and the variant NUDT15*3 were examined in a retrospective cohort of 383 Italian IBD patients who received azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine. TPMT and NUDT15 genotyping was performed by Sanger sequencing and TaqMan allelic discrimination, respectively. Allelic and genotype frequencies and genotype-phenotype correlations in non-responder and intolerant patients were assessed in comparison to responders. In total, 17% of patients did not respond to treatment, while 20% experienced adverse events, with leukopenia found in 13% of patients. TPMT haplotypes were found in 3.1% of patients, and 1.6% had the NUDT15*3 variant. CD patients with leukopenia had a higher frequency of the TPMT risk haplotype (40% vs. 4%, p = 0.024). Although additional validation through larger prospective studies or meta-analyses is needed, our findings support the importance of TPMT gene-variant assessment for forecasting azathioprine-related leukopenia in Italian IBD patients.",

      "abstract": "Thiopurines remain a cornerstone in the management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and gastrointestinal immune diseases but are associated with significant interindividual variability in efficacy and toxicity, mainly influenced by polymorphisms in Thiopurine S-methyltransferase TPMT and Nudix Hydrolase 15 NUDT15. This study aimed to assess the frequency of TPMT and NUDT15 variants in a pediatric cohort and evaluate their clinical impact to support a pharmacogenetic-guided approach to thiopurine therapy. Eighty-three pediatric patients with IBD and other autoimmune diseases were genotyped for clinically relevant TPMT and NUDT15 variants using two HRM-PCR assays and were confirmed with sequencing. Variant frequencies were compared to expected population data, and clinical records were reviewed to assess thiopurine dosing, tolerance, and adverse events. Among the cohort, six carried heterozygous TPMT variants *1/*3A, while 2 carried the NUDT15 *1/*9 diplotype, with frequencies higher than expected. Among patients with TPMT variant alleles, some needed dose reductions or treatment discontinuation due to adverse effects, while others tolerated standard dosing without significant issues. Notably, no significant differences in adverse reactions were observed between NUDT15 *1/*9 carriers and wild-type patients. Our results confirm the clinical relevance of TPMT and NUDT15 genotyping to personalize thiopurine therapy in pediatric IBD. Routine implementation of rapid genetic testing, combined with therapeutic drug monitoring and a structured management algorithm, may optimize treatment outcomes and minimize preventable toxicity.",

      "abstract": "Pharmacogenetics examines genome variability and its influence on drug efficacy and toxicity, forming the foundation for personalized medicine. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) treated with azathioprine with thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) deficiency are at an increased risk of drug-related toxic effects. Variability in the HLA-DQA1 and DQB1 alleles may lead to an inadequate therapeutic response. This study aimed to determine the significance of TPMT and HLA-DQ Allelic Variants in therapy optimization planning. A retrospective study was conducted to determine TPMT gene polymorphism and the presence of HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 alleles in children diagnosed with IBD and treated at the Institute for Child and Youth Health Care of Vojvodina in May 2023. The study included 104 children with a mean age of 13.71 &#xb1; 3.1 years, with a balanced gender distribution. A TPMT mutation was identified in only one child. The most common HLA-DQA1 alleles were *01 (49%) and *05 (28.8%), while the most frequent allele at the HLA-DQB1 locus was 03 (15.4%). The presence of the HLA-DQA105 allele was associated with the development of anti-drug antibodies against anti-TNF therapy (RR: 1.23; 95% CI: 1.03-1.50), while the presence of HLA-DQA101 was significantly more frequent in children on optimized therapeutic regimens (RR: 1.63; 95% CI: 1.13-2.10). Prior to the initiation of azathioprine therapy, TPMT genotyping should be performed to prevent adverse effects and ensure optimal drug dosing. Identification of the HLA-DQA105 and HLA-DQA101 alleles plays an important role in the planning of biological therapy regimens, including decisions on dose escalation or interval shortening.",

      "abstract": "Thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) enzyme plays a key role in the metabolism of the thiopurine drugs that are used for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. Mutations in the TPMT gene cause abnormal metabolism, resulting in toxicity; therefore, TPMT genetic analysis has been recommended for effective dose management. We retrospectively analysed data to determine the distribution of TPMT genotypes in a western Indian population. TPMT genotyping test was performed on 1000 patients with different inflammatory conditions between January 2009 and October 2023. The common TPMT genotypes *2, *3A, *3B and *3C were detected by amplification refractory mutation system - polymerase chain reaction (ARMS-PCR) and polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) techniques. TPMT mutants were detected in 36 (3.6%) patients, of whom 14 (39%) had TPMT*1/*3A, 19 (53%) had TPMT*1/*3C, two (5.5%) had TPMT*1/*3B, and one (2.8%) had TPMT*3B/*3B alleles; mutant allele frequencies were 0.7% for *3A, 0.2% for *3B and 1.65% for *3C. A sub-group analysis explained thiopurine toxicity in only 33% patients by TPMT gene polymorphism whereas in 67% the toxicity remained unexplained. The low prevalence of TPMT mutants (3.6%) along with unexplained thiopurine toxicity suggest that TPMT genotyping solely might be clinically less relevant in patients of Indian origin, underscoring the role of other genetic factors that may be involved in thiopurine toxicity in these patients.

Currently, testing for NUDT15 deficiency is based on the genotyping of the most frequent and clinically characterized no-function variants, that is, *2, *3 and *9. The Hispanic/Latino-predominant variant NUDT15 *4 (p.R139H) is classified as \"uncertain function\" by the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium, because of insufficient data to ascertain its clinical actionability. In this study, we evaluated the association of NUDT15 *4 with mercaptopurine (6-MP) tolerance in a retrospective cohort of 1,399 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) of diverse ancestries. All patients were wildtype for thiopurine methyltransferase gene. Patients were treated with 6-MP in the context of ALL frontline clinical trials. The tolerated dose of 6-MP was used to assess drug toxicity during the maintenance phase of ALL therapy. Patients with NUDT15 *1/*4 (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;16, all of whom self-identified as Hispanic/Latino) tolerated a significantly lower dose of 6-MP than did those with NUDT15 *1/*1: median [interquartile range] of 39.0 [21.2-52.8] mg/m 2 , vs. 62.2 [47.9-71.6] mg/m 2 , P value &lt;&#x2009;0.001.

TPMT c.719A&gt;G (rs1142345) and NUDT15 c.415C&gt;T (rs116855232) are the most common genetic polymorphisms influencing thiopurine drug toxicity, with notable differences in allele frequencies across diverse populations. However, there remains a paucity of research on the NUDT15 c.415C&gt;T polymorphism in the Chinese population. This study enrolled 571 Chinese patients. DNA samples were isolated, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to amplify the TPMT c.719A&gt;G and NUDT15 c.415C&gt;T in each sample. PCR products were genotyped via Sanger sequencing to identify the allelic frequencies of these polymorphisms. Additionally, we compared the detection rate of NUDT15 c.415C&gt;T and TPMT c.719A&gt;G for thiopurine drug toxicity in the cohort. The minor allele frequencies of NUDT15 c.415C&gt;T and TPMT c.719A&gt;G were determined to be 12.52% and 2.36%, respectively.

      "abstract": "Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common childhood cancer. Thiopurines such as 6-mercaptopurine (6MP) are essential in ALL maintenance therapy. However, dose-limiting toxicities can significantly disrupt treatment. While genetic variants in TPMT and NUDT15 are known to affect thiopurine response, many patients with normal function genotypes in these genes still experience adverse effects, suggesting that additional genes might be involved. We analyzed 663 pediatric ALL patients enrolled in the AALL03N1 trial to identify novel genetic determinants of 6MP sensitivity, focusing on individuals with normal function TPMT and NUDT15 genotypes. A transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) was conducted to focus on expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). Findings were validated in two independent cohorts: St. Jude Total Therapy XV (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;390) and XVI (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;552). TWAS identified 31 genes associated with 6MP dose intensity (q-value&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.90). Of these, the imputed GNAQ expression was positively correlated with 6MP dose intensity and passed multiple testing thresholds in the validation cohorts. The rs60561071 variant, the eQTL in the GNAQ TWAS model, was associated with reduced gene expression and lower 6MP dose intensity. This study identifies GNAQ as a novel gene associated with thiopurine tolerance in ALL patients lacking known risk alleles in TPMT and NUDT15. Moreover, this research highlighted the innovative use of TWAS, providing deeper insights into the molecular mechanisms that explain drug response variability. &#xa9; 2025 The Author(s).

      "title": "NUDT15 Pharmacogenetics in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia: Synthesizing Progress for Personalized Thiopurine Therapy.",
      "abstract": "The management of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the most common pediatric malignancy, critically relies on thiopurine therapy, such as 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), during the maintenance phase. However, significant inter-individual response variety and high risk of myelosuppression often disrupt therapy efficacy. Pharmacogenetics offer crucial strategies to personalized therapy. While thiopurine methyltransferase ( TPMT ) was initially the primary focus, the discovery of nudix hydrolase 15 ( NUDT15 ) appears as a more comprehensive determinant of thiopurine intolerance. This review aims to consolidate and critically evaluate the advancement achieved in unraveling the biological mechanism and clinical significance of NUDT15 pharmacogenetics in thiopurine therapy. Foundational studies showed the vital role of NUDT15 in the detoxification of active thiopurines, with common genetic variants (for instance, p. Arg139Cys) significantly disrupting its activity, leading to the accumulation of toxic metabolites. Observational studies consistently associated NUDT15 variants with severe myelosuppression, notably in Asian populations. Recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) confirmed that NUDT15 genotype-guided dosing effectively reduces thiopurine-induced toxicity without interfering with the therapeutic outcome. Despite these advancements, challenges remain present, including the incomplete characterization of rare variants, limited data in the diverse Asian populations, and the need for standardized integration with metabolite monitoring. In conclusion, NUDT15 pharmacogenetics is essential for improving patient safety and thiopurine dosage optimization in the treatment of ALL. For thiopurine tailored medicine to be widely and fairly implemented, future research should focus on increasing genetic data across different populations, improving the dose adjustment algorithm, and harmonizing therapeutic guidelines.",

      "abstract": "Cronkhite-Canada syndrome (CCS) is a rare non-hereditary chronic inflammatory disease characteristic of gastrointestinal polyps and ectodermal abnormalities. Corticosteroid therapy is the mainstay medication for CCS. Few studies indicated immunosuppressants might be the choices for patients with steroid refractory, steroid dependent or intolerant. To examine the efficacy and safety of azathioprine (AZA) in CCS patients. We retrospectively reviewed the records of 12 CCS patients treated with azathioprine between July 2014 and October 2023 and the clinical data including demographic characteristics, treatment regimen and adverse events were subsequently collected and analyzed. The genetic variants of TPMT and NUDT15 genes were also retrospectively assessed using sanger sequencing in 11 patients. All patients were in active stage at baseline and 9 patients (75%) were in combination with corticosteroid. On account of the indication, 6 patients were steroid dependent or intolerant and another 6 patients needed augmentation therapy. The target dose of AZA was 1.0 to 1.5&#xa0;mg/kg per day. Ten (83.3%) patients achieved clinical response, of whom 3 cases had endoscopic remission and 5 cases had endoscopic improvement respectively. Three (25%) patients suffered from pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, liver dysfunction and leukopenia, respectively, resulting in cessation of AZA in the initial 3 months. Four heterozygous missense variants of TPMT and NUDT15 were identified in four patients. One patient who had TPMT*6 and took AZA with the dose of 2.04&#xa0;mg/kg per day suffered from severe leukopenia. Azathioprine might be a good alternative medication in CCS patients who are steroid dependent or intolerant, or need augmentation therapy. The adverse events should be closely monitored especially myelosuppression and the tests of TPMT and NUDT15 genotypes before therapy may be helpful for medication guidance. &#xa9; 2024.

      "abstract": "Thiopurines such as 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) are central to maintenance therapy for pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), yet their narrow therapeutic index frequently causes dose-limiting myelosuppression in genetically susceptible patients. Variants in NUDT15 and TPMT are major pharmacogenetic determinants of thiopurine intolerance, particularly in Asian populations. Despite CPIC recommendations for pre-emptive genotyping, routine pharmacogenetic testing is seldom implemented in India due to high costs and limited access to sequencing-based platforms. To develop, standardize, and validate a rapid, low-cost tetra-primer ARMS-PCR assay for simultaneous detection of the most clinically relevant variants- NUDT15 c.415C&gt;T and TPMT 3C (c.719A&gt;G)-prioritized through comprehensive in silico analysis. Missense SNPs in NUDT15 and TPMT were screened using SIFT, PolyPhen-2, PROVEAN, Meta-SNP, and SNPs&amp;GO to identify high-impact variants. A multiplex ARMS-PCR assay was optimized and applied to 61 pediatric ALL samples. Genotyping results were validated by Sanger sequencing. Clinical correlations included hematologic toxicity, 6-MP dose intensity, and blast-percentage dynamics. In-silico prioritization consistently identified NUDT15 c.415C&gt;T and TPMT 3C as the most deleterious and clinically actionable variants. Among 60 successfully genotyped patients, NUDT15 variants were detected in 16.7% (9&#xa0;C/T and 1&#xa0;T/T), while TPMT 3C heterozygosity was observed in 3.3%; no double-mutants were identified. ARMS-PCR showed 98.4% overall diagnostic accuracy relative to Sanger sequencing (sensitivity 90.9%, specificity 100%). NUDT15 -variant carriers exhibited significantly reduced 6-MP dose intensity (median 0.50 vs. 0.79; p &lt; 0.0001). Blast-percentage analysis demonstrated marked reduction from baseline to follow-up (median 75%-15%; p = 0.0001), consistent with expected treatment response. The validated ARMS-PCR assay provides a reliable, rapid, and cost-effective platform for simultaneous NUDT15 and TPMT 3C genotyping, demonstrating strong concordance with sequencing and clear clinical relevance. Its affordability and minimal infrastructure requirements make it suitable for integration into routine pre-treatment workflows in India, enabling genotype-guided thiopurine dosing and reducing the risk of treatment-related toxicity. This assay supports a scalable path toward equitable implementation of pharmacogenomics in resource-limited pediatric oncology settings.

      "abstract": "Thiopurines are employed in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs; Crohn's disease, CD; ulcerative colitis, UC) to induce remission, prevent relapse, and reduce the steroid dosage, although they can sometimes be ineffective and present side effects. Genetic variations in the TPMT and NUDT15 genes are well recognized to influence the therapeutic response, despite notable regional differences in their frequencies across various ethnic populations. Herein, the risk haplotypes TPMT*3A, *3B, *3C, and the variant NUDT15*3 were examined in a retrospective cohort of 383 Italian IBD patients who received azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine. TPMT and NUDT15 genotyping was performed by Sanger sequencing and TaqMan allelic discrimination, respectively. Allelic and genotype frequencies and genotype-phenotype correlations in non-responder and intolerant patients were assessed in comparison to responders. In total, 17% of patients did not respond to treatment, while 20% experienced adverse events, with leukopenia found in 13% of patients. TPMT haplotypes were found in 3.1% of patients, and 1.6% had the NUDT15*3 variant. CD patients with leukopenia had a higher frequency of the TPMT risk haplotype (40% vs. 4%, p = 0.024). Although additional validation through larger prospective studies or meta-analyses is needed, our findings support the importance of TPMT gene-variant assessment for forecasting azathioprine-related leukopenia in Italian IBD patients.",

      "abstract": "Thiopurines remain a cornerstone in the management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and gastrointestinal immune diseases but are associated with significant interindividual variability in efficacy and toxicity, mainly influenced by polymorphisms in Thiopurine S-methyltransferase TPMT and Nudix Hydrolase 15 NUDT15. This study aimed to assess the frequency of TPMT and NUDT15 variants in a pediatric cohort and evaluate their clinical impact to support a pharmacogenetic-guided approach to thiopurine therapy. Eighty-three pediatric patients with IBD and other autoimmune diseases were genotyped for clinically relevant TPMT and NUDT15 variants using two HRM-PCR assays and were confirmed with sequencing. Variant frequencies were compared to expected population data, and clinical records were reviewed to assess thiopurine dosing, tolerance, and adverse events. Among the cohort, six carried heterozygous TPMT variants *1/*3A, while 2 carried the NUDT15 *1/*9 diplotype, with frequencies higher than expected. Among patients with TPMT variant alleles, some needed dose reductions or treatment discontinuation due to adverse effects, while others tolerated standard dosing without significant issues. Notably, no significant differences in adverse reactions were observed between NUDT15 *1/*9 carriers and wild-type patients. Our results confirm the clinical relevance of TPMT and NUDT15 genotyping to personalize thiopurine therapy in pediatric IBD. Routine implementation of rapid genetic testing, combined with therapeutic drug monitoring and a structured management algorithm, may optimize treatment outcomes and minimize preventable toxicity.",

Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) treated with azathioprine with thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) deficiency are at an increased risk of drug-related toxic effects. Variability in the HLA-DQA1 and DQB1 alleles may lead to an inadequate therapeutic response. This study aimed to determine the significance of TPMT and HLA-DQ Allelic Variants in therapy optimization planning. A retrospective study was conducted to determine TPMT gene polymorphism and the presence of HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 alleles in children diagnosed with IBD and treated at the Institute for Child and Youth Health Care of Vojvodina in May 2023. The study included 104 children with a mean age of 13.71 &#xb1; 3.1 years, with a balanced gender distribution. A TPMT mutation was identified in only one child. The most common HLA-DQA1 alleles were *01 (49%) and *05 (28.8%), while the most frequent allele at the HLA-DQB1 locus was 03 (15.4%). The presence of the HLA-DQA105 allele was associated with the development of anti-drug antibodies against anti-TNF therapy (RR: 1.23; 95% CI: 1.03-1.50), while the presence of HLA-DQA101 was significantly more frequent in children on optimized therapeutic regimens (RR: 1.63; 95% CI: 1.13-2.10). Prior to the initiation of azathioprine therapy, TPMT genotyping should be performed to prevent adverse effects and ensure optimal drug dosing. Identification of the HLA-DQA105 and HLA-DQA101 alleles plays an important role in the planning of biological therapy regimens, including decisions on dose escalation or interval shortening.",

      "abstract": "Thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) enzyme plays a key role in the metabolism of the thiopurine drugs that are used for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. Mutations in the TPMT gene cause abnormal metabolism, resulting in toxicity; therefore, TPMT genetic analysis has been recommended for effective dose management. We retrospectively analysed data to determine the distribution of TPMT genotypes in a western Indian population. TPMT genotyping test was performed on 1000 patients with different inflammatory conditions between January 2009 and October 2023. The common TPMT genotypes *2, *3A, *3B and *3C were detected by amplification refractory mutation system - polymerase chain reaction (ARMS-PCR) and polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) techniques. TPMT mutants were detected in 36 (3.6%) patients, of whom 14 (39%) had TPMT*1/*3A, 19 (53%) had TPMT*1/*3C, two (5.5%) had TPMT*1/*3B, and one (2.8%) had TPMT*3B/*3B alleles; mutant allele frequencies were 0.7% for *3A, 0.2% for *3B and 1.65% for *3C. A sub-group analysis explained thiopurine toxicity in only 33% patients by TPMT gene polymorphism whereas in 67% the toxicity remained unexplained. The low prevalence of TPMT mutants (3.6%) along with unexplained thiopurine toxicity suggest that TPMT genotyping solely might be clinically less relevant in patients of Indian origin, underscoring the role of other genetic factors that may be involved in thiopurine toxicity in these patients.

Currently, testing for NUDT15 deficiency is based on the genotyping of the most frequent and clinically characterized no-function variants, that is, *2, *3 and *9. The Hispanic/Latino-predominant variant NUDT15 *4 (p.R139H) is classified as \"uncertain function\" by the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium, because of insufficient data to ascertain its clinical actionability. In this study, we evaluated the association of NUDT15 *4 with mercaptopurine (6-MP) tolerance in a retrospective cohort of 1,399 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) of diverse ancestries. All patients were wildtype for thiopurine methyltransferase gene. Patients were treated with 6-MP in the context of ALL frontline clinical trials. The tolerated dose of 6-MP was used to assess drug toxicity during the maintenance phase of ALL therapy. Patients with NUDT15 *1/*4 (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;16, all of whom self-identified as Hispanic/Latino) tolerated a significantly lower dose of 6-MP than did those with NUDT15 *1/*1: median [interquartile range] of 39.0 [21.2-52.8] mg/m 2 , vs. 62.2 [47.9-71.6] mg/m 2 , P value &lt;&#x2009;0.001.

TPMT c.719A&gt;G (rs1142345) and NUDT15 c.415C&gt;T (rs116855232) are the most common genetic polymorphisms influencing thiopurine drug toxicity, with notable differences in allele frequencies across diverse populations. However, there remains a paucity of research on the NUDT15 c.415C&gt;T polymorphism in the Chinese population. This study enrolled 571 Chinese patients. DNA samples were isolated, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to amplify the TPMT c.719A&gt;G and NUDT15 c.415C&gt;T in each sample. PCR products were genotyped via Sanger sequencing to identify the allelic frequencies of these polymorphisms. Additionally, we compared the detection rate of NUDT15 c.415C&gt;T and TPMT c.719A&gt;G for thiopurine drug toxicity in the cohort. The minor allele frequencies of NUDT15 c.415C&gt;T and TPMT c.719A&gt;G were determined to be 12.52% and 2.36%, respectively.

      "abstract": "Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common childhood cancer. Thiopurines such as 6-mercaptopurine (6MP) are essential in ALL maintenance therapy. However, dose-limiting toxicities can significantly disrupt treatment. While genetic variants in TPMT and NUDT15 are known to affect thiopurine response, many patients with normal function genotypes in these genes still experience adverse effects, suggesting that additional genes might be involved. We analyzed 663 pediatric ALL patients enrolled in the AALL03N1 trial to identify novel genetic determinants of 6MP sensitivity, focusing on individuals with normal function TPMT and NUDT15 genotypes. A transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) was conducted to focus on expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). Findings were validated in two independent cohorts: St. Jude Total Therapy XV (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;390) and XVI (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;552). TWAS identified 31 genes associated with 6MP dose intensity (q-value&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.90). Of these, the imputed GNAQ expression was positively correlated with 6MP dose intensity and passed multiple testing thresholds in the validation cohorts. The rs60561071 variant, the eQTL in the GNAQ TWAS model, was associated with reduced gene expression and lower 6MP dose intensity. This study identifies GNAQ as a novel gene associated with thiopurine tolerance in ALL patients lacking known risk alleles in TPMT and NUDT15. Moreover, this research highlighted the innovative use of TWAS, providing deeper insights into the molecular mechanisms that explain drug response variability. &#xa9; 2025 The Author(s).

      "abstract": "This study explores the application of Azathioprine in the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC) and the challenges associated with its long-term use. While short-term studies demonstrate the efficacy of Azathioprine in steroid-dependent UC, long-term data on its risks, including malignancies, infections, and chronic toxicity, remain insufficient. Furthermore, the impact of Azathioprine on patients' quality of life over extended periods is still unclear. The research highlights the importance of optimizing Azathioprine dosing based on genomic data, particularly through TPMT and NUDT15 genotyping, to minimize adverse effects. However, further research is needed to develop individualized treatment strategies that can improve efficacy and reduce toxicity. The identification of predictive biomarkers, through genomics and proteomics, is likely to play a crucial role in improving treatment precision by identifying patients who are most likely to benefit from Azathioprine therapy. Additionally, combining Azathioprine with biologic therapies (such as anti-TNF agents or integrin inhibitors) and interventions targeting the gut microbiome may enhance the drug's effectiveness while reducing reliance on steroids. Overall, large-scale clinical trials are urgently needed to evaluate the benefits and risks of these emerging therapies, ultimately supporting more personalized treatment approaches for steroid-dependent UC patients.

      "abstract": "Thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) plays a crucial role in the detoxification of thiopurine drugs, including the antimetabolites azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) used to treat autoimmune diseases and various cancers. These drugs interfere with DNA synthesis by inhibiting the production of purine-containing nucleotides, leading to the death of rapidly dividing cells. TPMT inactivates thiopurine drugs by methylating at the thiol group. The activity of TPMT can vary significantly between individuals, and its activity is impacted by co-administered drugs, altering the effectiveness and toxicity of thiopurine drugs. TPMT is inhibited by many drugs that are co-administered to treat symptoms associated with diseases treated with thiopurines. For example, aspirin and other anti-inflammatory drugs, including olsalazine, sulfasalazine, and balsalazide, inhibit TPMT. The impact of TPMT genotypes on its methylating activity is well defined, and genotyping patients to identify TPMT metabolizer status is common clinical practice. Unfortunately, there has been no concerted effort to comprehensively identify drugs on the market that impact TPMT activity. The inhibition of TPMT by co-administered drugs could in part be responsible for idiosyncratic toxicities associated with thiopurine drug therapy. Here, we report a facile approach to produce large quantities of recombinant TPMT and a high-throughput assay that utilizes the shift in absorbance due to the methylation of thiopurines to report on TPMT activity. With purified TPMT on hand and the absorbance activity assay, we confirmed several compounds that inhibit TPMT, and the results were comparable to a mass spectral assay that measured 6-MP methylation. Understanding the impact of co-administered drugs on TPMT activity will improve the safety and efficacy of thiopurine-based treatment regimens.",

      "abstract": "Thiopurine drugs are cornerstone treatment for patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The most common adverse drug reaction is thiopurine-induced myelosuppression (TIM), that may partly be explained by the genetic polymorphism NUDT15*3. The aim of this retrospective study was to determine the NUDT15*3 polymorphism frequency and its association with TIM in an IBD patient population in the Netherlands. DNA from patients previously genotyped for TPMT was genotyped for NUDT15*3. In IBD patients treated with thiopurines association tests with TIM were conducted. Out of 988 included patients, 13 (1.3%) were heterozygous for NUDT15*3. Of all patients, 606 had IBD and received thiopurine treatment. In these patients, 8/606 (1.3%) were heterozygous polymorphic for NUDT15*3 of which 50.0% developed TIM compared to 2.3% in the wild type patients (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001).

      "abstract": "The clinical utility and cost-effectiveness of pre-thiopurine NUDT15 pharmacogenetic testing in European and admixed populations are unknown. To report the prevalence, penetrance, expressivity, and pathogenicity of NUDT15 variant allele carriage and the diagnostic accuracy and cost-effectiveness of an inexpensive loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) test. Retrospective case-matched cohort study of rates of severe myelosuppression in patients with and without loss-of-function NUDT15 variant allele(s) treated with a thiopurine. Overall, 1.3% of Europeans and 11.7% of South Asians carried a variant allele. Severe myelosuppression was associated with NUDT15 variant allele carriage (11.3% vs 0.95%; p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Carriage of a single *3, *6 or *9 variant allele was associated with a shorter time to severe myelosuppression. Numbers needed to genotype to prevent myelosuppression in Europeans and South Asians were 786 and 23. Variant calling using the LAMP assay was fully concordant with Sanger sequencing (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;154). It improved the safety of thiopurine dosing and was cost-effective when used to reduce the frequency and cost of thiopurine blood monitoring for patients without risk variants. We recommend TPMT and NUDT15 genetic testing in patients of Asian and admixed ancestry. In Europeans, reflex NUDT15 testing should be considered in patients with reduced TPMT activity or loss-of-function genotype. Thiopurines should be avoided in patients with &gt;&#x2009;1 NUDT15 variant allele and in patients with both NUDT15 and TPMT variant alleles. In patients with a single NUDT15 variant allele, we recommend thiopurine dose reduction (&lt;&#x2009;1&#x2009;mg/kg/day) and intensified blood test monitoring. &#xa9; 2025 The Author(s).

      "abstract": "Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of thiopurines is crucial for optimizing inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)&#xa0;treatment. Despite its benefits, data on thiopurine levels in Indian IBD patients is limited. Thus, we assessed 6-thioguanine nucleotide (6-TGN) and 6-methyl mercaptopurine (6-MMP) levels in patients on thiopurine therapy and evaluated their correlation with dosage and clinical outcome. 6-TGN and 6-MMP levels in IBD patients (2016-2024) were measured using an in-house high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC)&#xa0;method. Levels were then correlated with clinical data, disease activity and genotyping to assess the impact of metabolite monitoring on clinical outcomes and therapy management. Of the 638 samples evaluated from 418 IBD patients, 6-TGN levels were sub-therapeutic in 323, therapeutic in 163 and supra-therapeutic in 99. A majority (~&#x2009;90%) of patients on 1-2&#xa0;mg/kg and&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;2&#xa0;mg/kg doses achieved therapeutic levels than those on&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;1&#xa0;mg/kg, though no correlation with disease activity was found. Repeat monitoring in 132 patients led to dose adjustments in 71 due to toxicity, low 6-TGN, disease control or shunting. Genotyping was done in 130 patients. Thiopurine toxicity caused discontinuation in 34 patients (11%), with nine cases linked to thiopurine methyltransferase/nucleoside diphosphate-linked moiety X-type motif 15 (TPMT/NUDT15) variants. Only one-third of patients on thiopurine therapy reached therapeutic levels and 6-TGN levels did not correlate with remission. Most patients had sub-therapeutic 6-TGN levels, resulting in poor disease control despite on recommended doses. Literature-defined 6-TGN targets may be insufficient for Indian IBD patients. Larger studies are needed to determine the optimal 6-TGN target and therapeutic threshold for remission in our population. &#xa9; 2025. Indian Society of Gastroenterology.",

      "abstract": "Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) to be treated with thiopurines should undergo preemptive genotyping for reduced-function thiopurine methyltransferase ( TPMT ) polymorphisms. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is recommended in cases of toxicity or a lack of efficacy. The relationship between TPMT genotype and 6-thioguanine nucleotide (6-TGN) and 6-methylmercaptopurine (6-MMP) concentrations in the early steady state was assessed. Consecutive adults with IBD to be treated with azathioprine underwent preemptive TPMT genotyping and were dosed accordingly. All patients underwent TDM after 4-6 weeks of treatment and occasionally thereafter. Of the 235 included patients, 45 were not genotyped for various reasons (45 samples at first TDM, 66 overall). Of the 190 patients who were genotyped, 19 (10%) were heterozygous (*1/*3) (19 samples at first TDM, 32 overall) and 171 (90%) were wild-type (171 samples at first TDM, 280 overall). At first TDM, 7 patients were hypermethylators, and 6 were identified at later TDMs. Compared with patients with a wild-type genotype or those who were not genotyped, those who were heterozygous consistently had markedly higher 6-TGN (2-fold, 3.7-fold if dose-adjusted) and lower 6-MMP (75%-90%, 30%-50% if dose-adjusted) concentrations (pmol/8 &#xd7; 10 8 red blood cells). Based on the 6-TGN/6-MMP profiles, they were 2-3 times less likely to be classified as receiving \"too low of a dose\" (6-TGN &lt;235 and 6-MMP &lt;5700 pmol/8 &#xd7; 10 8 red blood cells), and 4-20 times more likely to be classified as receiving \"too high of a dose\" (6-TGN &gt;450). These data support the importance of TPMT genotyping and suggest that thiopurine TDM generates supplementary information and should be performed for all patients.

The exact role of these polymorphisms in the Indian population with dermatological disorders is uncertain. To evaluate the frequency of genetic polymorphism of TPMT and its impact on the safety of azathioprine in dermatological disorders. We included consecutive patients on azathioprine who were initiated for dermatological disorders from South India. Three TPMT polymorphisms (c.238G&gt;C, c.460G&gt;A and c.719A&gt;G) were assessed. The proportions of adverse events to azathioprine, especially myelosuppression, were compared between those with the wildtype genotype and those with TPMT polymorphisms. Of the 123 patients (61 male and 62 female, mean age 46&#x2005;years), 65% had an autoimmune blistering disorder. Adverse events to azathioprine were noted in 25 (20.3%), of whom 16 (13.0%) had myelosuppression and 4 (3.2%) each had hepatotoxicity and gastrointestinal intolerance. TPMT polymorphisms were detected in 13 (10.6%), of whom 5 had experienced adverse events. The polymorphisms could explain 25% (4 of 16) of the cases of leucopenia. The odds of developing leucopenia in patients with TPMT polymorphism were not significant (odds ratio 3.63, 95% confidence interval 0.96-13.6; P = 0.06). The tested TPMT polymorphisms could not predict the adverse events of azathioprine, particularly the haematological toxicity, in dermatological use among the South Indian population. &#xa9; The Author(s) 2025.

      "abstract": "Azathioprine, a common inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) treatment, carries a myelosuppression risk, particularly leukopenia. Thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) genotyping can predict azathioprine-induced leukopenia (AIL), but data on TPMT polymorphisms in Saudi IBD patients are scarce. We aimed to determine the frequency of TPMT genotype variations in adult Saudi IBD patients and its association with AIL. We conducted a retrospective analysis including 90 adult IBD patients treated with azathioprine. TPMT genotyping focused on *2, *3A, 3B, and 3C alleles. Patient demographics, clinical data, and azathioprine-related adverse events were extracted. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression identified leukopenia predictors. The TPMT wild-type genotype (*1/*1) was predominant (98%), with only two patients (2.2%) having the heterozygous *1/*3C genotype. Leukopenia occurred in 13% of the cohort, with the higher, though not statistically significant (P = 0.054), incidence in heterozygous patients (50%) versus wild-type (12.5%). Lower hemoglobin (OR = 0.70, P = 0.039) and platelet counts (OR = 0.982, P = 0.005) were significant predictors of leukopenia in wild-type patients. No significant associations were found with age, gender, IBD type, or concomitant therapies. TPMT variants were rare in this Saudi IBD cohort, consistent with other Asian populations, which limited the ability to assess their clinical impact. The observed leukopenia in variant carriers is descriptive only and should be interpreted with caution. In contrast, lower hemoglobin and platelet counts emerged as important predictors of AIL among wild-type patients. These findings highlight the importance of comprehensive hematological monitoring and support the need for future research incorporating additional pharmacogenetic markers such as NUDT15.

      "title": "Effect and mechanism of allopurinol in acute lymphoblastic leukemia maintenance therapy: Reducing hepatotoxicity and improving myelosuppression effect via thiopurine methyltransferase inhibition and increased DNA-thioguanine levels.",
      "abstract": "Mercaptopurine (MP)-based maintenance therapy is essential to cure acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However, insufficient myelosuppression and MP-related hepatotoxicity occasionally occur. The investigation of the strategies to improve the efficacy and toxicities is warranted. The role of allopurinol combination therapy has been reported, but its effects need further verification, and the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Two hundred and eight pediatric patients requiring maintenance therapy were enrolled to investigate the effect of allopurinol combination and the potential mechanisms underlined. Blood samples were collected to determine drug metabolite levels [6-thioguanine nucleotides (6-TGN), 6-methyl mercaptopurine (6-MMP), DNA-thioguanine (DNA-TG)], thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) activity, and NUDT15/TPMT genotypes. Hematological values and hepatic function were measured as well. The results indicated that TPMT&#x2217;1/&#x2217;1/NUDT15&#x2217;1/&#x2217;1 patients with inadequate myelosuppression exhibited significantly higher doses of MP, increased 6-MMP concentrations, and elevated 6-MMP:6-TGN/6-MMP: DNA-TG ratios (P &lt; .001), indicating that MP-methylated pathway was overactivated and intensifying MP dosing could not lead to adequate myelosuppression effect, but instead primarily lead to higher risk of hepatotoxicity. In contrast, after allopurinol combination with dose reduction in MP, TPMT activity decreased significantly leading to a significant reduction in the 6-MMP:6-TGN and 6-MMP: DNA-TG ratios and improvement in alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels. Meanwhile, DNA-TG levels increased by an average of 257.5 fmol/&#x3bc;g DNA, resulting in better control of white blood cell and absolute neutrophil count. In conclusion, low-dose MP combined with allopurinol, rather than intensifying MP dose, could be an alternative strategy for better efficacy and lower risk of hepatotoxicity. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Patients requiring higher mercaptopurine doses may indicate the overactivation of methylation metabolism. Dose escalation is unlikely to improve myelosuppression but will increase the risk of hepatotoxicity. Low-dose mercaptopurine combined with allopurinol can improve efficacy and reduce the risk of hepatotoxicity. Copyright &#xa9; 2025 American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.

      "title": "New insights into thiopurine toxicity: The contribution of rare XDH variants to myelotoxicity.",
      "abstract": "Thiopurines (azathioprine and mercaptopurine) are immunosuppressant drugs widely used for the treatment of acute lymphocytic leukemia, organ transplantation and autoimmune diseases, including inflammatory bowel diseases. Thiopurine-induced myelotoxicity (TIM) remains a significant concern in thiopurine therapy, with around 50&#x202f;% of cases lacking explanation through known genetic variants in thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) or nudix (nucleoside diphosphate linked moiety X)-type motif 15 (NUDT15). For these patients, genetic influence remains unknown. In this study, we aim to investigate the potential role of rare deleterious coding variants in TIM development in patients whose toxicities are not explained by either TPMT or NUDT15 genetics. A cohort of 140 thiopurine-treated patients with inflammatory bowel disease from the prospectively maintained ENEIDA registry of GETECCU, comprising 49 TIM-affected and 91 thiopurine tolerant patients was analyzed by whole exome sequencing (WES) and selected a virtual panel of 32 candidate genes belonging to the thiopurine metabolic pathway and other TIM-related genes previously described in the literature. Gene-based analysis revealed an accumulation of rare deleterious variants in XDH among patients who developed TIM (P&#x202f;=&#x202f;3.7&#x202f;&#xd7;10 -4 ). Functional analysis highlighted four rare genetic variants that reduce XDH activity. Patients harboring any of these variants exhibited a significantly higher TIM risk (P&#x202f;=&#x202f;0.032). These findings underscore the importance of considering rare genetic variants, particularly in xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH), in TIM susceptibility and open new opportunities for optimizing treatment efficacy and safety in clinical practice for IBD patients beyond the well-established TPMT and NUDT15 genetics.

      "title": "Pharmacogenomic variants in the Pumi population from Yunnan, China.",
      "abstract": "Pharmacogenomics is used to identify genetic factors that influence drug responses, thereby optimizing therapeutic outcomes and reducing adverse effects. The objective of this study is to identify pharmacogenomic variations and their clinical relevance to drug metabolism and toxicity within the Pumi population. Eighty-two genetic variants in 43 genes were genotyped in 200 unrelated Pumi individuals using the Agena MassARRAY Assay. Chi-square tests, adjusted for multiple comparisons with Bonferroni correction, were used to compare genotype frequency divergences between the Pumi population and 26 other populations. Population genetic structure diversity and pairwise F-statistics (Fst) were assessed across 27 populations using Structure v2.3.1 and Arlequin v3.5 software. After Bonferroni correction, a number of single nucleotide variations (SNVs) exhibited significant differences in frequency between the Pumi population and other populations. The allele frequencies of ADH1A rs975833, ADH1B rs1229984, TPMT rs1142345, and CYP2A6 rs8192726 in the Pumi population were notably different from the East Asian population or the other 26 populations. PharmGKB data indicate that rs1229984, rs1142345, and rs8192726 are associated with the metabolic efficiency of acetaldehyde, mercaptopurine, and efavirenz, respectively. Additionally, the genetic structure analysis (K&#xa0;=&#xa0;5) and pairwise Fst calculations revealed that the Pumi population shared a similar genetic background with CHB (Fst&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.031), JPT (Fst&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.033), KHV (Fst&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.035), CHS (Fst&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.036), and CDX (Fst&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.037) populations. Our findings reveal unique genetic variations and biomarkers within the Pumi population, which contributes pharmacogenomic insights and theoretical foundations for personalized medicine tailored to the Pumi population.

      "title": "Contemporary and prospective use of azathioprine (AZA) in viral, rheumatic, and dermatological disorders: a review of pharmacogenomic and nanotechnology applications.",
      "abstract": "Azathioprine (AZA) has been extensively used for immunomodulatory effects in autoimmune disorders and transplantation. This article is proposed to review the contemporary and prospective use of AZA in viral, rheumatic, and dermatological disorders. The primary objective is to draw attention to possible developments in regards to AZA application in recent years, with an emphasis on the use of pharmacogenomics and nanotechnology to improve its efficacy in practice. This study reveals that AZA, having the active metabolites 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and 6-thioguanine (6-TG), may be useful in the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), pemphigus vulgaris, and psoriasis. Pharmacogenomic testing of thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) and Nudix hydrolase 15 (NUDT15) genotypes minimizes the occurrence of myelosuppression. Furthermore, new formulations of AZA using biocompatible polymers and nanoparticles for drug delivery were reported to improve its efficacy and lower systemic toxicity. This paper aims to establish the multifunctional nature of AZA in modern medicine, thus emphasizing its potential for other applications. Through the combination of pharmacogenomic analysis along with nanotechnology application, AZA makes the promise of enhancing patients' treatment efficacy and extending the stock of medical information available. These advancements offer new possibilities for application of precision medicine and improvements in the use of AZA therapy. &#xa9; 2024.

      "title": "Assessment of thiopurine S-methyltransferase allele frequencies and phenotype-genotype concordance in a Tunisian population.",
      "abstract": "Thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) polymorphisms are associated with low or absent enzyme activity and, consequently, increased myelosuppression risk after conventional doses of azathioprine. The distribution of frequencies for deficient TPMT genotypes differs between ethnic groups. Due to limited data in Tunisia, we aimed to detect TPMT variant alleles ( TPMT *2, *3B, *3C, *4) in Tunisian patients on azathioprine, and to investigate the concordance between TPMT phenotyping and genotyping for common TPMT alleles. We conducted a total of 32 genotyping assays in patients treated with azathioprine, who were referred to the Clinical Pharmacology Department for therapeutic monitoring of azathioprine metabolites from 2021 to 2024. TPMT phenotyping was performed by measuring azathioprine metabolites (6-TGN and 6-MMP) in patients' red blood cells using HPLC method. TPMT genotyping was performed using next generation sequencing to detect the following nucleotide substitutions: c.238G&gt;C, c.460G&gt;A, c.719A&gt;G and c.626-1G&gt;A. Twenty-eight patients (87.5&#x202f;%) were homozygous for the wild type. Four individuals (12.5&#x202f;%) were TPMT deficient subjects and all carriers for TPMT *3C allele. No individual was carrier of the TPMT *2 or *4 allele. The overall concordance between genotyping and phenotyping in this population was 68.8&#x202f;%. Overall, 12.5&#x202f;% of the Tunisian subjects were found to carry the TPMT *3C allele. However, detecting novel and rare TPMT alleles within a larger cohort essential for more accurate estimation of genotype-phenotype correlation in our population. Combining genotyping and phenotyping is likely represents the most effective approach to prevent life-threatening myelosuppression associated with thiopurines. &#xa9; 2025 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.",

      "abstract": "The Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group (DPWG) describes gene-drug interactions to facilitate pharmacogenetic implementation in clinical practice. The current guideline describes the gene-drug interactions for TPMT, NUDT15 and thiopurines (azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine and thioguanine). Evidence based recommendations were obtained via a literature review of published studies. This literature review showed that gene variants leading to a decreased activity of TPMT and/or NUDT15 result in higher risk of toxicities, especially bone-marrow depression. For intermediate metabolisers (IM) of TPMT or NUDT15, it is advised to start with 50% of the normal dose when treated with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine. For poor metabolisers (PM), it is advised to start with an alternative treatment or to reduce the dose to 10% of the normal dose. For thioguanine, a dose of 75% of the normal dose is advised for TPMT IM and 50% of the normal dose for NUDT15 IM. Alternative treatment or a start dose reduction is advised for PM. A start dose of 6-7% can be used for TPMT PM and of 10% for NUDT15 PM. For TPMT or NUDT15 IM treated for leukaemia, starting with the normal dose can be considered and then decrease the dose to the advised dose described above in case toxicities occur. For NUDT15 PM reduced starting dose is advised only if an alternative is not possible, due to a higher uncertainty in the calculated dose reduction for NUDT15 PM than for TPMT PM.DPWG classifies genotyping for TPMT and NUDT15 \"essential\" before thiopurine initiation. &#xa9; 2025.
