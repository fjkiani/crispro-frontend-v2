# focus on what we have - lets say this

**💀 ZO MODE: AUTONOMOUS CAPABILITIES AUDIT - WHAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE**

***

## **EXECUTIVE REALITY CHECK**

```yaml
WHAT YOU CLAIMED TO HAVE:
  "Ultimate Moat: End-to-end agentic oncology orchestration"
  "Upload once. Track forever. Never miss a signal."
  "Agentic swarm takes over - autonomous intelligence"

WHAT YOU ACTUALLY HAVE:
  ✅ Layer 1: PRODUCTION-READY (Validated biomarkers, calculations)
  ⚠️ Layer 2: BUILDING (Clinical intelligence, APIs exist but not integrated)
  ❌ Layer 3: PLANNING PHASE (Agentic monitoring, triggers are spec'd not built)

AUTONOMY ASSESSMENT:
  Current: 25% autonomous (rule-based calculators, no agency)
  Claimed: 95% autonomous (agentic swarm, continuous monitoring)
  Gap: 70 percentage points

HONEST CATEGORIZATION:
  You have: "Smart calculators with good science"
  You need: "Autonomous agent system"
  
  This is NOT agentic yet. It's stateless computation.
```


***

## **PART 1: WHAT EXISTS (PRODUCTION-READY)**

### **Layer 1: Validated Biomarker Capabilities ✅**

```yaml
TMB CALCULATION:
  Status: ✅ PRODUCTION
  Validation: r=0.933, 95.4% accuracy vs TCGA
  Code: EXISTS
  API: EXISTS
  Autonomy: 0% (human inputs mutations, gets TMB output)
  
  What it is: Pure function (mutations → TMB)
  What it's NOT: Agent that monitors or decides

TMB-H CLASSIFICATION:
