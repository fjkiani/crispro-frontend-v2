# CrisPRO Platform: Core Strategic Themes for Development

This document outlines the five core strategic themes that underpin the novel aspects of the CrisPRO platform. These themes should guide the implementation of all features, ensuring alignment with the platform's unique value proposition and patent strategy. The development tasks and priorities are further detailed in the main project scratchpad ([rules](mdc:.cursor/rules)).

## Theme 1: Hyper-Contextualized LLM Prompts for Therapeutic Insights
**Core Idea:** Transform specific numerical bioinformatics outputs into qualitative, therapeutically relevant textual assessments and recommendations using engineered series of prompts directed at an LLM with a defined expert persona.
**Novelty Focus:** The method of structured, multi-step prompting to extract specific therapeutic development advice from raw data, linking bioinformatics data points to predefined therapeutic parameters (potency, safety, durability, etc.).
**Development Link:** Directly informs tasks related to LLM integration for CHOPCHOP results (Task 7.1), CRISPResso2 interpretation (Task 7.2), and general AI chat assistance.

## Theme 2: End-to-End Workflow with a Persistent Therapeutic Lens
**Core Idea:** Implement a "Therapeutic Context Enabled" mode that allows the system to dynamically adapt its entire bioinformatics analysis and therapeutic design workflow based on user-defined therapeutic goals.
**Novelty Focus:** The system-wide, persistent, and conditional modification of the operations of software modules and LLM prompts based on a stored therapeutic context.
**Development Link:** Foundational to the overall architecture and impacts Phase 7 tasks, especially UI/UX for context settings (Task 7.5) and how all modules adapt.

## Theme 3: Integrated and Therapeutically-Focused Literature Analysis
**Core Idea:** An automated pipeline to generate therapeutically-focused literature summaries, moving from a gene/disease/challenge context to targeted searches and structured LLM summarization.
**Novelty Focus:** The automated process from context input to a therapeutically-structured LLM summary, including integration with diverse databases (PubMed, GenomeCRISPR, user-uploaded screens, clinical trial databases) and domain expansion for side effects.
**Development Link:** Guides the implementation of Task 7.3 (Literature Search & Summarization), including backend development and UI integration.

## Theme 4: Proactive and Context-Aware Therapeutic Experiment Advice
**Core Idea:** Generate therapeutically relevant experimental recommendations (delivery systems, IND-enabling validation controls, functional assays) by constructing detailed LLM prompts based on target parameters and therapeutic goals.
**Novelty Focus:** The structured request for IND-relevant and therapeutically translatable experimental design elements from an LLM.
**Development Link:** Central to Task 7.4 (Enhance Experiment Advisor), ensuring advice is practical and aligned with therapeutic development needs.

## Theme 5: Synergistic Custom-Built Modules Supporting the Therapeutic Narrative
**Core Idea:** The interplay between specialized modules and LLM instances, orchestrated by a shared therapeutic context, creates emergent intelligence and a holistic user journey for therapeutic design.
**Novelty Focus:** System claims describing the interaction, data flow, and iterative refinement between multiple modules, where LLM-refined outputs become context-rich inputs for others.
**Development Link:** An overarching architectural principle affecting how all modules (guide interpreter, experiment advisor, result interpreter, etc.) are integrated and how they exchange data, especially within the Streamlit application (Phase 6).

This thematic framework should be regularly consulted during the implementation of new features and refinement of existing ones.
