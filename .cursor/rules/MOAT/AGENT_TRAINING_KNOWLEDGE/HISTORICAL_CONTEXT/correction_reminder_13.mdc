```yaml
WEEK 5-6: VALIDATION AGENT
  Build:
    - Validation library (per data type: mutations, TMB, trials)
    - Error detection rules (schema, range, completeness)
    - Self-correction strategies (retry, alternative parsers, LLM fallback)
    - Human escalation (flag ambiguous cases)
  
  Deliverable:
    - Data extraction validates mutations (HGVS format, ClinVar check)
    - Biomarker calculation validates TMB (range 0-100, cohort size check)
    - Trial matching validates mechanism fit (vector dimensions match)
  
  Enables:
    ✅ Self-correction (70% of errors fixed automatically)
    ✅ Error transparency (human knows WHY flagged)

WEEK 7-8: ITERATION ENGINE
  Build:
    - Evaluation function (quality scoring per task)
    - Refinement strategy generator (adjust params, switch tools)
    - Convergence criteria (quality threshold, max iterations)
    - Improvement tracker (logs scores per iteration)
  
  Deliverable:
    - Trial matching iterates until mechanism fit >0.85 OR 3 iterations
    - Drug ranking iterates until confidence >0.80 OR no improvement
  
  Enables:
    ✅ Self-improvement (results quality increases 10-20%)
    ✅ Fewer user corrections needed
```

### **Phase 3: Monitoring \& Triggers (Weeks 9-12)**

```yaml
WEEK 9-10: EVENT TRIGGER SYSTEM
  Build:
    - Trigger definitions (YAML config per trigger type)
    - Trigger evaluator (checks conditions on data updates)
    - Action executor (sends alerts, re-runs agents)
    - Notification service (email, SMS, dashboard push)
  
  Deliverable:
    - Trigger: CA-125 >25% rise → Alert oncologist + re-run resistance analysis
    - Trigger: New trial matches mechanism >0.90 → Notify + add to dashboard
    - Trigger: TMB-H detected → Update IO eligibility + re-rank drugs
  
  Enables:
    ✅ Proactive monitoring (system watches, doesn't wait for user)
    ✅ Early alerts (3-6 weeks before clinical progression)

WEEK 11-12: MONITORING AGENTS
  Build:
    - CA-125 kinetics monitor (tracks serial CA-125, calculates slopes)
    - ctDNA monitor (watches for MAPK mutations, ABCB1 upregulation)
    - Treatment response monitor (RECIST 1.1 classification)
    - Adverse event monitor (CTCAE grading)
  
  Deliverable:
    - Continuous monitoring dashboard (live updates)
    - Alerts sent to oncologist (configurable thresholds)
  
  Enables:
    ✅ "Track forever" (continuous surveillance)
    ✅ "Never miss a signal" (proactive detection)
```

### **Phase 4: Goal Management \& UI (Weeks 13-16)**

```yaml
WEEK 13-14: GOAL MANAGER
  Build:
    - Goal registry (priority queue, dependencies)
