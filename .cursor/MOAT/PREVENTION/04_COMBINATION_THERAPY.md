# 04 — Combination Therapy (DDR_bin-Guided)

**Purpose:** Define the “add a second agent early” strategy when DDR_bin signals escape.

---

## Core Idea

When resistant clone is still small (≈5–15%), adding a second agent can suppress the resistant population before dominance.

---

## Inputs

- Baseline DDR_bin, latest DDR_bin, trend
- Current therapy class
- Tolerance constraints (toxicity, labs)
- Contraindications

---

## Decision Rule (Template)

### Trigger
- DDR_bin crosses WARNING/ALERT threshold (Manager-defined)

### Tier 1 candidate combos (Manager picks canonical)
- PARP + **low-dose carboplatin** (AUC 2–3)
- PARP + bevacizumab
- PARP + ATR inhibitor (trial)

### Outputs
- Tiered options with evidence level + safety notes

---

## Safety & Evidence

- **Key risk:** hematologic toxicity
- Must show: “Discuss with oncologist” unless Manager allows stronger language
