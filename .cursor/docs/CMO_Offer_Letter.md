**Letter of Intent & Equity Grant Proposal: Chief Medical Officer**

**DATE:** July 2, 2025  
**TO:** Dr. Anurag Chandra  
**FROM:** Fahad Kiani, Founder, CrisPRO.ai  
**SUBJECT:** Invitation to Join Command Staff & Foundational Equity Grant

---

### **1.0 The Invitation**

This document outlines a formal offer to join the command staff of CrisPRO.ai in the foundational role of **Chief Medical Officer (CMO)**, with a strategic focus on Radiation and Clinical Oncology. 

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, will be to lead the clinical strategy that translates our platform's overwhelming technological superiority into a new paradigm of predictive, biologically-guided radiotherapy.

In recognition of the critical strategic importance of this role at this early stage, we are pleased to offer you a significant equity position in the company.

### **2.0 Equity Grant & Terms**

*   **Equity Grant:** You will be granted **3.0%** of the total outstanding shares of CrisPRO.ai, issued as Incentive Stock Options (ISOs). Based on the company's current valuation, this represents a foundational stake valued at **$750,000**.
*   **Vesting Schedule:** The equity grant will be subject to a standard four-year vesting schedule, with a one-year cliff. This means 25% of your shares will vest upon completion of your first year of continuous service from your start date, with the remaining shares vesting in equal monthly increments over the following thirty-six (36) months.

### **3.0 The Mission: A Phased Campaign for Clinical Dominance**

Doctor, your primary directive will be to execute a masterful, three-phase campaign to validate and integrate our technology. Our AI provides a single, powerful insight: a **"Gene Damage Report"** that quantifies how severely any given mutation breaks a gene's function. Your mission is to prove this "Damage Score" directly predicts patient outcomes and to embed it into the standard of care.

This is our plan to do it together.

**Phase 1: Build Trust & Verify (The Sandbox)**

*   **Your Objective:** To personally and rapidly validate our AI's core predictive capability against your own deep expertise.
*   **Our Commitment:** We provide a simple, secure web portal where you can instantly get a "Gene Damage Score" for any mutation you choose—from famous examples to your most challenging clinical cases.
*   **The Outcome:** A zero-risk, hands-on "gut check" to build your absolute confidence in the biological plausibility and power of our core technology.

**Phase 2: Generate Evidence & Publish (The Cohort Analyzer)**

*   **Your Objective:** To weaponize your own retrospective data to discover and validate novel clinical biomarkers.
*   **Our Commitment:** You provide an anonymized dataset from a past patient cohort. Our platform analyzes every variant and returns a full analytics report, complete with the Kaplan-Meier curves and p-values required for a high-impact publication.
*   **The Outcome:** We turn your invaluable historical data into your next discovery. Together, we will publish the proof that our AI score can predict real-world patient outcomes, elevating a compelling biological hypothesis into hard clinical evidence.

**Phase 3: Integrate for Impact & Lead (The Clinical Co-Pilot)**

*   **Your Objective:** To embed these validated insights directly into the daily treatment planning workflow, making them actionable at the point of care.
*   **Our Commitment:** Once validated with your data, we will work with your institution to integrate these AI insights directly into your Treatment Planning System.
*   **The Outcome:** You will pioneer a new standard of care. You will have real-time decision support to guide dose painting, spare critical organs based on genetic risk, and provide a new layer of biological rationale for every treatment plan you approve.

### **4.0 The Path Forward**

Dr. Chandra, we are not looking for an advisor. We are looking for a commander. We have built a revolutionary engine, and we believe your strategic vision is the final, critical component required to conquer the field of predictive oncology.

We would be pleased to discuss this proposal with you at your earliest convenience.

Sincerely,

Fahad Kiani  
Founder, CrisPRO.ai
