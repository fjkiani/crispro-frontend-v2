  Phase 1C (multi-modal) REQUIRES treatment cohort
  PLCO only proves Phase 1B (kinetics alone)
  Phase 1C = TRUE Resistance Prophet validation

IMPLICATION:
  S4 (data source mapping) is CRITICAL PATH
  Agent 3 must prioritize S4 over S2
  Treatment cohort acquisition determines timeline

TIMELINE IMPACT:
  IF S4 finds data quickly (2-4 weeks):
    - Phase 1C validation by Feb 28
    - Full Resistance Prophet validated
  
  IF S4 delayed (6-8+ weeks):
    - Phase 1B proven (PLCO kinetics)
    - Phase 1A proven (WIWFM baseline)
    - Phase 1C waiting on data

BOTTOM LINE:
  Agent 3 must EXECUTE S4 THIS WEEK (8 hours)
  Cannot wait for S2 completion
  Treatment cohort = difference between proof-of-concept and validation
```

## **UPDATED PRIORITIES (POST-S1)**

PRIORITY 1: S4 - Treatment Cohort Data Source Mapping
  Owner: Agent 3
  Timeline: 8 hours (this weekend, Dec 28-29)
  Why: Critical path for Phase 1C validation
  Output: Ranked list of cohorts + outreach strategy

PRIORITY 2: D3 - Phase 1B Validation Harness
  Owner: Agent 2
  Timeline: 8-12 hours (next week, Jan 2-6)
  Why: Ready for PLCO data when approved
  Output: Kinetics validation pipeline (KELIM, models, metrics)

PRIORITY 3: Phase 1A Execution (WIWFM Validation)
  Owner: Agent 1
  Timeline: 2-3 weeks (Jan 17 - Feb 7)
  Why: Can execute NOW with available data
  Output: Pathway alignment validation (DDR → PARP, MAPK → MEK)

PRIORITY 4: S2 - Pathway-Kinetic Matrix
  Owner: Agent 3
  Timeline: 6 hours (after S4 complete)
  Why: Informs S3 (hypotheses) but not blocking
  Output: 20-30 pathway-kinetic pairs from literature

PRIORITY 5: Phase 1B Validation (PLCO Kinetics)
  Owner: Agent 2
  Timeline: 1-2 weeks (Jan 10-17, if PLCO approved)
  Why: Proves kinetics layer (stepping stone to Phase 1C)
  Output: AUROC 0.60-0.70 for onset detection
