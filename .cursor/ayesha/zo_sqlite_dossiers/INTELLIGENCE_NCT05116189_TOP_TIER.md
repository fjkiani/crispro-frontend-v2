## 🎯 WHY THIS TRIAL IS A GOOD FIT FOR AYESHA (LLM Analysis)

### **Clinical Trial Analysis: NCT05116189**

**Note**: This is a structured fallback analysis (LLM unavailable).

#### **1. Drug Mechanism Fit**
The trial "Pembrolizumab/Placebo Plus Paclitaxel With or Without Bevacizumab for Platinum-resistant Recurrent Ovarian Cancer (MK-3475-B96/KEYNOTE-B96/ENGOT-ov65)" requires detailed mechanism analysis. Review the trial protocol to understand how the investigational drug addresses Ayesha's Stage IVB High-Grade Serous Ovarian Carcinoma with extensive tumor burden and pleural metastases.

#### **2. Location Logistics**
Review trial locations to identify NYC metro sites accessible from ZIP 10029 (East Harlem). Preferred centers: Mount Sinai (local), MSK (2 miles), NYU Langone (3-4 miles).

#### **3. Risk-Benefit for Ayesha**
**Key Considerations**:
- Pulmonary compromise: Large bilateral pleural effusions require careful monitoring
- ECOG 1: Acceptable for most trials, but toxicity profile is critical
- Tumor burden: Extensive disease (CA-125 >2800) may require aggressive initial treatment

#### **4. Comparison to Standard of Care**
Ayesha's planned SOC is Carboplatin + Paclitaxel + Bevacizumab (NCCN-guideline first-line therapy for Stage IVB HGSOC, BRCA wildtype). This trial should be compared to this regimen to assess:
- Is it a replacement for SOC (frontline trial)?
- Is it additional to SOC (maintenance trial)?
- Is it an alternative if SOC fails?

#### **5. Critical Considerations**
1. **Biomarker testing**: HER2 and HRD status are unknown - may be required for enrollment
2. **Timing**: When should Ayesha enroll? Before SOC, during SOC, or after response?
3. **Clinical team review**: Discuss with Ayesha's oncologist before enrollment decisions

**Recommendation**: Full protocol review with clinical team required.

Participants may have received a prior poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor (PARPi), anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 therapy, bevacizumab, or hormonal therapy; these will not be considered a separate line of therapy. Any chemotherapy regimen change due to toxicity in the absence of disease progression will be considered part of the same line of therapy.
* Has provided documented informed consent for the study.
* Has radiographic evidence of disease progression within 6 months (180 days) after the last dose of platinum-based chemotherapy for OC (i.e., platinum-resistant disease).
* Is a candidate for paclitaxel chemotherapy (and bevacizumab, if using).
* Has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 1 assessed within 3 days before randomization.
* For a female participant, she is not pregnant or breastfeeding, and at least one of the following conditions applies: Is not a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) OR Is a WOCBP and uses a contraceptive method that is highly effective (with a failure rate of \<1% per year).
* Has radiographically evaluable disease, either measurable or nonmeasurable per RECIST 1.1, as assessed by the local site investigator.
* Archival tumor tissue sample or newly obtained core or incisional/excisional biopsy of a tumor lesion not previously irradiated has been provided.
* Have adequate organ function. * Has nonepithelial cancers, borderline tumors, mucinous, seromucinous that is predominantly mucinous, malignant Brenner's tumor and undifferentiated carcinoma.
* Has primary platinum-refractory disease, defined as disease that has progressed per radiographic imaging while receiving or within 28 days of the last dose of first-line platinum-based therapy.
* Has prior disease progression on weekly paclitaxel alone.
* Has received \>2 prior lines of systemic therapy for OC.
* Has received prior systemic anticancer therapy including investigational agents or maintenance therapy (including bevacizumab maintenance therapy), within 4 weeks before randomization.
* Has received prior radiation therapy within 2 weeks of start of study intervention.
* Has not recovered adequately from surgery and/or any complications from the surgery.
* Has received colony-stimulating factors (e.g., granulocyte colony-stimulating factor \[G-CSF\], granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor,\[GM-CSF\] or recombinant erythropoietin) within 4 weeks before randomization.
* Has received a live or live-attenuated vaccine within 30 days before the first dose of study intervention.
* Has received investigational agent or has used an investigational device within 4 weeks prior to study intervention.
* Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy.
* Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or has required active treatment within the past 3 years.
* Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis.
* Has severe hypersensitivity (≥Grade 3) to pembrolizumab, paclitaxel, or bevacizumab (if using) and/or any of their excipients.
* Has an active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years.
* Has a history of (noninfectious) pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease that required steroids or has current pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease.
* Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.
* Has a known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.
* Has a known history of Hepatitis B or known active Hepatitis C virus infection.
* Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, laboratory abnormality, or other circumstance that might confound the results of the study.
* Has a known psychiatric or substance abuse disorder that would interfere with the participant's ability to cooperate with the requirements of the study.
* Participant, in the judgement of the investigator, is unlikely to comply with the study procedures, restrictions, and requirements of the study.
* Has had an allogenic tissue/solid organ transplant.

For bevacizumab treatment

* Has uncontrolled hypertension.
* Has current, clinically relevant bowel obstruction including related to underlying epithelial OC, abdominal fistula or gastrointestinal perforation, intra-abdominal abscess, or evidence of rectosigmoid involvement by pelvic exam.
* Has a history of thrombotic disorders, hemorrhage, hemoptysis, or active gastrointestinal bleeding within 6 months before randomization.

## 📊 TRIAL DESCRIPTION

The primary objective is to compare pembrolizumab plus paclitaxel with or without bevacizumab to placebo plus paclitaxel with or without bevacizumab, with respect to progression-free survival (PFS) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 as assessed by the investigator. The hypotheses are that pembrolizumab plus paclitaxel with or without bevacizumab is superior to placebo plus paclitaxel with or without bevacizumab, with respect to PFS per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by the investigator for participants with programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) positive tumors (Combined Positive Score \[CPS\] ≥1) and that pembrolizumab plus paclitaxel with or without bevacizumab is superior to placebo plus paclitaxel with or without bevacizumab, with respect to PFS per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by the investigator for all participants.

## ⚔️ TACTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS

**Priority**: 🔥 **P0 - IMMEDIATE ACTION** (Eligibility: ~100%)

**Next Steps**:
1. **Order biomarker tests** (HER2 IHC, HRD if not done)
2. **Contact trial site** (within 48 hours)
3. **Pre-screen Ayesha** (get on coordinator's radar)
4. **Decision at Week 2**: Enroll if eligible
5. **Prepare medical records** (surgical report, pathology, CA-125 history)

**Expected Timeline**:
- Week 1: Complete L1 chemo (cycle 6)
- Week 2: Biomarker results available
- Week 3: Enroll in trial (if eligible) or proceed with SOC maintenance


---

## 🎯 VALUE PROPOSITION

**WIN-WIN SCENARIO**:
- If eligible (100% chance) → Access to experimental therapy
- If not eligible → Gets proven SOC (PARP or bevacizumab maintenance)
- Either way, Ayesha receives appropriate care

**Risk-Benefit**: Low risk (pre-screening doesn't commit to enrollment), high reward (cutting-edge therapy)
