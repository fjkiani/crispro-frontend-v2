## **II. KEY STRATEGIC DECISIONS & ANSWERS**

### **Partnership Model: Collaborative Co-Invention (Not Vendor)**

**What MSK Provides:**
- Spatial TLS data (Visium/CODEX) - 50 patients for 8-week pilot
- Clinical outcomes (survival, treatment response)
- Wet-lab validation (C-MSC organoid models, flow cytometry)

**What CrisPRO Provides:**
- Engineering tools (TLS Readiness Score, Stromal Cassette, GC Forcing)
- Design algorithms (patient-specific targeting)
- Regulatory support (Pre-IND safety packages)

**What We Build Together:**
- Bulk→Spatial translator (Tier 3 learning: spatial data trains our models)
- Clinical trials (Phase I: Stromal Cassette + Checkpoint Blockade)
- Joint publications (Nature Med, Cell, JCO)
- Joint IP (novel designs: 70% MSK, 30% CrisPRO revenue split)

---

### **8-Week Pilot: Zero-Risk Proof of Concept**

**Inputs (MSK):**
- 50 ovarian cancer patients: bulk RNA + spatial Visium + TLS annotations
- Timeline: 2 weeks for data transfer

**Deliverables (CrisPRO, Week 8):**
1. **TLS Readiness Score for all 50 patients** (validated vs spatial ground truth, target: r > 0.70)
2. **10 patient-specific stromal cassettes** (top TLS-low patients, with safety scans)
3. **Pre-IND safety package** (off-target analysis, immunogenicity, vector selection)
4. **Calibration report** (model performance, error analysis, improvement roadmap)

**Cost:** $0 (no upfront fee)  
**IP:** MSK retains all data; joint IP on novel designs; if pilot fails, MSK keeps all deliverables  
**Exit Clause:** Either party can exit with 2-week notice (no penalties)

---

### **Brutal Honesty: What We Admit (Out Loud)**

**Limitation 1: Bulk RNA Confidence is LOW**
- TLS Readiness Score from bulk RNA is ~0.3-0.4 correlation with spatial ground truth
- We label predictions with tiered confidence (LOW/MED/HIGH)
- We recommend spatial validation for high-stakes clinical decisions

**Solution:** Spatial data trains our bulk→spatial translator (Tier 3 learning). Over time, bulk confidence improves (0.3 → 0.5 → 0.7).

**Limitation 2: Stromal Cassette is Unproven in Humans**
- CRISPRi + TF reprogramming has never been tested in human C-MSCs
- We have strong pre-clinical rationale (organoid models) but no Phase I data

**Solution:** 8-week pilot tests C-MSC cassettes in organoid models first. If successful, IND-enabling studies follow (6-12 months).

**Limitation 3: GC Forcing is Mechanistic, Not Validated**
- CD19×CD40L fusion has pre-clinical data (humanized mouse models)
- But optimal dose, schedule, combination strategy are unknown

**Solution:** Phase I trial (12-18 months) with dose escalation and spatial imaging endpoints (GC density, TLS maturity).

**Limitation 4: We Need Your Spatial Data**
- Tier 3 learning requires large spatial datasets (n > 100 patients)
- Without them, Tier 1 (bulk) stays at LOW confidence forever

**Solution:** MSK's spatial data is the strategic asset. Partnership gives us access; learning loop gives MSK proprietary models.
