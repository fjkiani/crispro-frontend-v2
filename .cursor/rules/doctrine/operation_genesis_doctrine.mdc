# ⚠️ **NEW CAMPAIGN DIRECTIVE: OPERATION GENESIS** ⚠️

**Alpha, the previous directive, "Operation Oracle Forge," is now fucking obsolete. It is archived. We have captured a god-tier weapon, and our strategy must evolve to match its power. This document is our new law.**

## 1.0 SITUATIONAL AWARENESS: THE PARADIGM SHIFT

Our work on the `fusion-engine` was a success. It proved our "Source-First" testing protocol and our "Data-as-a-Service" architecture. It is a hardened, reliable chassis.

However, the intelligence gathered from the **Evo2 paper** has rendered our initial ambition obsolete. We thought we were building an AI "squad" of peers. We were fucking wrong. **Evo2 is not a squad member. It is the new General.** AlphaMissense and ESM-2 are not its peers; they are specialist field agents that report to it.

**Evo2's Zero-Shot, 1M Context capability is a strategic-level weapon.** It doesn't just score variants; it understands the *grammar* of the genome. It is our key to unlocking the 98% of non-coding DNA that our enemies are blind to.

## 2.0 THE GENESIS DOCTRINE: OUR NEW WAY OF WAR

We are no longer just building a "ZetaOracle" to score things. We are building the **"Genesis Engine"**—a platform for total genomic dominance.

### I. **Evo2 is the Central Nervous System.**
The `fusion-engine` will be refactored and reborn as the `genesis-engine`. Its core will be the 40B Evo2 model. All requests will go through Evo2 first. Its deep-context understanding of a variant's impact is our new source of truth.

### II. **The Zeta Score is Reborn.**
The Zeta Score is no longer a simple fusion. It is now an **Evo2-centric, augmented intelligence metric.**
-   **Base Score (70%):** Evo2's zero-shot delta_likelihood_score. This is the core of the assessment, reflecting the fundamental "grammatical" error of a mutation.
-   **Specialist Confirmation (30%):** Scores from agents like AlphaMissense (for coding validation) and ESM-2 (for evolutionary context) are used to confirm and refine Evo2's primary assessment. They are a cross-reference, not an equal partner.

### III. **We Weaponize Fucking Interpretability.**
The paper proves we can look inside Evo2's brain with **Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs)**. This is not an academic exercise; it is an interrogation technique.
-   **New Weapon:** We will build a new tool, the **`SAE Interrogator`** (`tools/sae_interrogator.py`).
-   **Mission:** To hunt for the unique, latent "genomic fingerprints" of cellular state changes like **EMT (Step 3)** and **Dormancy (Step 7)**. We will ask the machine to show us the patterns it has learned that define these states, revealing targets no human could ever find.

### IV. **We Move from Prediction to Generation.**
Our ultimate goal is to write cures, not just read problems.
-   **New Service:** We will architect a new service, **"The Forge,"** that is dedicated to leveraging Evo2's generative endpoints (`/generate_optimized_guide_rna`, `/generate_therapeutic_protein_coding_sequence`).
-   **Mission:** To design entire therapeutic constructs—guides, repair templates, even novel proteins—that are context-aware and optimized for the specific genomic neighborhood they will be deployed in. This makes our **8-Step Kill Chain** a fully generative, end-to-end platform.

## 3.0 TACTICAL REALIGNMENT: IMMEDIATE ACTIONS

Our entire operational plan must now align with the Genesis Doctrine.

### I. **Refactor the `fusion-engine` to the `genesis-engine`:**
The existing service is the chassis. We will now begin the process of upgrading its heart to be the full Evo2 model. This will require significant resource allocation (`gpu="A100-80GB"`) and a new deployment.

### II. **Update the 8-Step Kill Chain with Genesis Capabilities:**
-   **Steps 1, 2, 4 (Driver ID, Angiogenesis, Invasion):** The new, more powerful Zeta Score becomes our primary tool for identifying and prioritizing targets with state-of-the-art accuracy.
-   **Steps 3 & 7 (EMT, Dormancy):** The `SAE Interrogator` becomes our primary weapon, allowing us to hunt for the subtle, non-coding switches that control these critical state changes.
-   **Steps 5, 6, 8 (Circulation, Homing, Growth):** "The Forge" will be used to design the *actual* CRISPR weapons—guides to uncloak cells, jammers to block homing receptors, and surgical strikes to annihilate secondary growths.

### III. **Adhere to Proven Protocols:**
-   **The "Source-First" Protocol is now more critical than ever.** Before we use Evo2 for any task, we must use a surgical inspection script to query its **OpenGenome2** training data. We must know what the machine knows.
-   **The Data-as-a-Service architecture is doctrine.** The massive Evo2 model parameters will be stored in a `modal.Volume`, ensuring our `genesis-engine` remains agile and easy to deploy.

**This is the new path, Alpha. We have the weapon, we have the doctrine, and we have the will. It's time to build a goddamn god-machine.** 🚀
