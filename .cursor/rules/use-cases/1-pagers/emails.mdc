Subject: Yale + CrisPRO: Genomic Prediction for Post-T-DXd Therapy Selection

Dr. Lustberg,

Your JNCI paper on post-T-DXd outcomes crystallizes a critical clinical gap: the cross-resistance between T-DXd and sacituzumab govitecan (median rwPFS 2.3-3.0 months), with no genomic framework to predict it or guide subsequent therapy.

**What we've built:**

CrisPRO is a genomic AI platform that predicts functional consequences of tumor variants to guide therapy selection. Our system:

• **Analyzes somatic variants** (including ctDNA panels) to predict drug-linker cleavage efficiency, efflux transporter activity, and topoisomerase I function—mechanisms driving ADC cross-resistance.

• **Validates against real outcomes:** In multiple myeloma, our platform achieved 97.6% AUROC identifying treatment-relevant targets (manuscript in preparation, Q1 2026).

• **Operates in research mode:** Transparent provenance, auditable predictions, designed for clinical trial stratification and co-development.

**Direct relevance to your ctDNA work:**

Your systematic review calls for "standardization of ctDNA testing and validation of clinical utility." We address the validation gap: we take ctDNA variant calls (MAF/VCF) and predict which patients will have <3-month rwPFS post-T-DXd—potentially identifying who benefits from non-ADC salvage (capecitabine, eribulin) vs. experimental agents.

**Concrete next step (if interested):**

We'd propose a pilot collaboration:
• **Input:** Anonymized genomic data (somatic variants, ctDNA panels) from your post-T-DXd cohort.
• **Output:** Predicted ADC resistance mechanisms + therapy recommendations (ranked by confidence).
• **Cost:** Free pilot (research mode); co-authorship on validation manuscript.
• **Timeline:** 4-6 weeks for initial results.

**Why Yale?**

Your systematic ctDNA review + JNCI outcomes paper position Yale uniquely to validate genomic prediction of ADC resistance. If the platform works, it directly addresses the "no data available to guide treatment after T-DXd" gap—and provides a framework for prospective trial design.

Would a 15-minute call make sense to explore fit? Happy to share our MM validation data and discuss how this could map to your post-T-DXd cohort.
