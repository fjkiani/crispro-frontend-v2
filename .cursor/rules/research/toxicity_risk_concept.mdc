# Toxicity Risk (Germline) – Execution Doctrine (Aug 2025)

This rule describes how to deliver the toxicity caution signal now using insights and evidence with transparent provenance.

## What we can deliver today (research‑grade)
- A ‘Toxicity Risk’ chip with:
  - **Helper text:** one sentence in plain language.
  - **Evidence (core):** Confidence · Evidence Tier (if enabled) · Sources (count + key refs) · Provenance (run_id, profile).

## Where the code lives (reused components)
- Insights router: `[insights.py](mdc:oncology-coPilot/oncology-backend-minimal/api/routers/insights.py)`
- Evidence + ClinVar proxy: `[evidence.py](mdc:oncology-coPilot/oncology-backend-minimal/api/routers/evidence.py)`
- Efficacy (for shared mapping/logging): `[efficacy.py](mdc:oncology-coPilot/oncology-backend-minimal/api/routers/efficacy.py)`

## How to run toxicity hint now
Embed toxicity as a small card in VUS/Radiation/Chemo flows when germline context is present. Sources and provenance included.

Example (ClinVar prior):
```bash
curl -sS "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/evidence/clinvar?chrom=7&pos=140453136&ref=T&alt=A"
```

## Methodology (simple, transparent)
- **Signals:** Map germline context to a conservative caution (repair/inflammation and related pathways).
- **Text:** One‑line helper explains why the hint appears.
- **Evidence:** Citations/badges when enabled; always include provenance.

## Frontend integration (no schema change required)
- Render a small “Toxicity Risk” chip with helper, confidence, sources, and provenance.
- Optional: cohort snippet when available.

## Current limitations (transparent)
- Not a diagnostic; research‑mode only. Signals are conservative and generic.
- Literature cues may be sparse in dev; keep text short and sourced when enabled.

## Success criteria
- Clear chip with helper and confidence.
- Sources and run ID present; easy to export.
- Optional cohort snippet visible when available.
