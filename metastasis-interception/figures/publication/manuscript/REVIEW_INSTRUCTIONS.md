## 🎯 WHAT TO REVIEW

### **PRIMARY REVIEW: Discussion Section**
**File:** `DISCUSSION_DRAFT.md` (1,540 words)

**Key Sections to Check:**
1. **Structural Validation Breakthrough** - Do we explain RNA-DNA thresholds clearly?
2. **Competitive Positioning** - Are we claiming first-mover status correctly?
3. **Clinical Impact** - Is $7.5K savings + 90% success rate credible?
4. **Limitations** - Are we honest enough about Enformer stubs + lack of wet-lab?
5. **Future Directions** - Is the roadmap realistic?

**Questions for You:**
- Does this tell the right story for Nature Biotechnology reviewers?
- Are we over-claiming or under-claiming?
- Any sections feel weak or need expansion?

---

### **SECONDARY REVIEW: Abstract**
**File:** `Abstract.md` (347 words)

**Check:**
- Is 347 words acceptable? (Nature Biotech allows 250-350)
