## **Opening: The $2.8 Billion Problem**

*"This is the average cost to bring a single new drug to market. Behind this number is a brutal reality: a 90% failure rate that has plagued pharmaceutical development for decades.*

*Today, I'm going to show you how we've built a platform that transforms this process from educated guesswork into computational precision."*

---

## **Act I: The Question That Costs Billions**

*"Every biotech company faces the same critical decision: Is this target worth a billion-dollar bet?*

*Traditional approaches require 18 months of expensive validation studies. Our platform answers this question in under 60 seconds using three computational engines working in sequence."*

**[Demo: Click "I need to validate PIK3CA E542K"]**

*"First, our sequence analysis engine - built on a 40 billion parameter model trained on 9.3 trillion genomic tokens - calculates the functional impact of this mutation.*

*The result: an 18,750% disruption score. This isn't marketing language - it's a mathematical measurement of how severely this mutation breaks the protein's normal function."*

**[Point to the 8750% gauge]**

*"But functional damage alone isn't enough. Cancer is clever - it finds workarounds. So our second engine analyzes data from over 1,000 cancer cell lines to answer a different question: How much does cancer actually depend on this broken gene?"*

**[Demo: Click "Check Cancer Dependency"]**

*"The answer: 92% essentiality. This means that in 92% of cancer types, removing this gene kills the cancer cells. This level of dependency exceeds validated targets like HER2, making it an exceptional therapeutic opportunity."*

**[Point to the dependency metrics]**

*"Finally, we need to know if we can actually reach this target with therapeutics. Our chromatin accessibility engine analyzes the 3D structure of DNA around this gene."*

**[Demo: Click "Assess Target Accessibility"]**

*"88% accessibility - meaning both gene editing tools and traditional small molecules can reach this target effectively. In under 60 seconds, we have mathematical certainty: this is a GO."*

## **Act II: From Target to Therapeutic**

*"Now comes the revolutionary part. Instead of screening millions of existing compounds hoping to find something that works, our generative engine designs therapeutics from scratch."*

**[Demo: Click "Design CRISPR Guides"]**

*"Our CRISPR design engine doesn't just find guide RNAs - it engineers them. Using evolutionary principles learned from analyzing every known genome, it generates a guide RNA with 94.5% predicted efficacy and zero high-priority off-target effects.*

*This isn't theoretical. The engine provides the exact DNA sequence, the experimental protocol, and the predicted outcomes."*

**[Point to the guide RNA sequence and metrics]**

*"But gene editing is just one approach. Our molecular design engine can also create entirely novel small molecule inhibitors."*

**[Demo: Click next step]**

*"Here, the engine has designed a completely new chemical compound that binds to the mutated PIK3CA protein with -12.3 kilocalories per mole of binding energy. For context, most FDA-approved drugs achieve -8 to -10. This is exceptionally strong binding."*

**[Point to the molecular structure and binding metrics]**

## **Act III: Validation Before the Lab**

*"But the most critical question remains: Will these designed therapeutics actually work in patients?*

*This is where our structural prediction engine comes in. Before synthesizing a single molecule, we simulate how it will behave in three-dimensional space."*

**[Demo: Show structural validation]**

*"The engine predicts an 87.2% structural confidence score. This means our designed molecules will fold correctly and maintain their function - a critical requirement that traditional drug discovery often discovers only after expensive synthesis and testing."*

**[Point to the 3D structure visualization]**

*"Let me show you what this means in concrete terms by examining the raw computational evidence."*

**[Point to Evidence Intelligence sidebar]**

*"This isn't a black box. Every decision is backed by specific data points. Here's the actual API response from our pathogenicity analysis - showing the exact numerical scores, confidence intervals, and comparative benchmarks that drove our GO decision."*

**[Show the raw JSON data]**

*"Our system doesn't just give you answers - it shows you exactly how it arrived at those answers, making every decision auditable and reproducible."*

---

## **Act IV: The Therapeutic Blueprint**

*"In traditional drug development, this process takes 3-5 years and costs $50-100 million just to reach this point. We've done it in 3 minutes.*

*The result is what we call a Therapeutic Blueprint - a complete, validated, de-risked asset ready for development."*

**[Demo: Show final dossier]**

*"This blueprint includes:
- Mathematical proof the target is vulnerable and essential
- Engineered therapeutics with predicted efficacy scores
- Structural validation confirming they'll work as designed
- Complete experimental protocols for immediate lab testing
- Intellectual property documentation for patent filing"*

---

## **Closing: The Paradigm Shift**

*"This represents a fundamental shift in how we develop therapeutics. Instead of expensive trial-and-error, we use computational precision. Instead of hoping molecules will work, we engineer them to work.*

*The result: dramatically higher success rates, faster development timelines, and lower costs. This isn't just an improvement to the existing system - it's a replacement for it."*

**[Final screen showing the complete dossier]**

*"Welcome to the future of therapeutic development."*
