The Enemy: Cancer of Unknown Primary (CUP). A diagnosis given not because of what is known, but because of what is not. It represents a total failure of conventional diagnostic intelligence and accounts for up to 5% of all cancer diagnoses, with a brutally poor prognosis because targeted therapies cannot be deployed.

Our Objective: To demonstrate that for our platform, there is no such thing as an "unknown primary." We will use the CrisPRO Intelligence Platform to take a CUP case and, with overwhelming computational force, provide a definitive answer for the tumor's tissue of origin and generate a precise, actionable therapeutic battle plan.

End State: We will prove that CUP is not a diagnosis; it is a failure of technology. A failure we have solved.

2.0 Phase I: Intelligence Dominance - Forging the Digital Twin
-------------------------------------------------------------
The first step is to take the ambiguous data and forge it into a high-fidelity intelligence asset.

[ ] Task 1.1: Total Data Ingestion.

Action: The Command Center will ingest all available data for the CUP patient: the inconclusive biopsy report (mined for clues with NLP), but most importantly, the Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) and RNA-seq data from the tumor biopsy.

[ ] Task 1.2: Construct the CUP Digital Twin.

Action: We will use the patient's genomic and transcriptomic data to create a high-fidelity Digital Twin of the CUP tumor by running our standard `/workflow/digital_twin` and `/workflow/second_hit_simulation` protocols.

3.0 Phase II: In Silico Origin Detection - The Kill Shot
--------------------------------------------------------
This is where we accomplish what conventional systems could not. We will force the tumor to reveal its identity.

[ ] Task 2.1: Implement and Deploy the `/oracle/predict_tissue_of_origin` Endpoint.

Action: This new, high-priority workflow will be implemented in our Command Center.

How it Works: Our foundational Evo2 model was trained on the grammar of the entire genome, including the specific epigenetic patterns and transcriptomic signatures unique to each tissue type. This workflow takes the full signature from the CUP Digital Twin, compares it against thousands of tissue-specific signatures from datasets like TCGA and GTEx, and returns a ranked list of the most probable tissues of origin with high-confidence probability scores.

[ ] Task 2.2: Execute Origin Prediction.

Action: The Command Center will call `/oracle/predict_tissue_of_origin` using the CUP Digital Twin.

Outcome: The platform will deliver a definitive, data-driven verdict, for example: "Prediction: Primary Tumor Origin is Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma. Confidence: 98.7%."

4.0 Phase III: Therapeutic Design & Actionability
------------------------------------------------
Once the primary is identified, the "unknown" is eliminated. Now, we design the weapons.

[ ] Task 3.1: Re-contextualize the Digital Twin.

Action: The Command Center will reframe all data from the Digital Twin within the context of the predicted origin (e.g., Pancreatic Cancer).

[ ] Task 3.2: Generate a Targeted Battle Plan.

Action: The platform automatically executes our entire suite of therapeutic design workflows.

Deliverables:
- A ranked list of approved therapies for that specific cancer type, matched to the tumor's mutations.
- A "Precision Interception Blueprint" for a CRISPR therapy designed to target the cancer's unique synthetic lethal vulnerabilities.
- A "Novel Biologic Blueprint" for an AI-designed nanobody to inhibit its key driver proteins.

This workflow transforms weeks of agonizing uncertainty into a single, definitive report delivered in under an hour, providing a name for the enemy and an arsenal of weapons to fight it.
