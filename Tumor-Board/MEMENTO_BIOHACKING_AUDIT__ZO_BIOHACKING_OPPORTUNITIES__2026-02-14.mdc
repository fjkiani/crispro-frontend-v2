# 🧬 MEMENTO BIOHACKING AUDIT — `ZO_BIOHACKING_OPPORTUNITIES.md` (Forward Proof)

**Date:** 2026-02-14  
**Scope:** Audit claims in `.cursor/ayesha/ZO_BIOHACKING_OPPORTUNITIES.md` (L1–L232) by working forward: find existing engine outputs, run endpoints, and save receipts.  
**Ground truth hierarchy (strict):**
1. **Bundle receipts**: `Tumor-Board/artifacts/payload.extracted.json` (captured tumor-board bundle)
2. **Runtime receipts**: JSON artifacts created during this audit in `Tumor-Board/artifacts/`
3. **Everything else**: flagged as “not proven here”

## 0) Source documents

- **Opportunities doc (claims source):** `.cursor/ayesha/ZO_BIOHACKING_OPPORTUNITIES.md` (L1–L232)
- **Tumor-board bundle (captured):** `Tumor-Board/artifacts/payload.extracted.json`

---

## 1) Opportunity 1 — MBD4-specific treatment intelligence (IO)

### 1.1 Claims (from opportunities doc)
- **C1**: “We detect MBD4, but we don’t leverage MBD4-specific literature.”
- **C2**: “MBD4 loss may predict immunotherapy response (hypermutation).”
- **C3**: Specific paper: “PMID 32661420 — MBD4 and immunotherapy response.”

### 1.2 Bundle alignment (payload-only)
- **MBD4 is present**: `levels.L1.inputs_used.mutations[*].gene == "MBD4"`  
- **MSI is MSS**: `levels.L1.inputs_used.tumor_context.msi_status == "MSS"`
- **PD-L1 is positive**: `patient_context.pd_l1_status == "POSITIVE"` and `patient_context.pd_l1_cps == 10`
- **TMB is missing**: `levels.L1.completeness.has_tmb == false`
- **IO boost did NOT trigger** (in efficacy gates): pembrolizumab includes “No IO boost signals detected”
  - `levels.L1.efficacy.drugs[?name=="pembrolizumab"].sporadic_gates_provenance.rationale[0].verdict == "NO_BOOST"`

### 1.3 Runtime reproduction (this audit)
- **Receipt (literature query attempt):** `Tumor-Board/artifacts/receipt__evidence_literature_mbd4_query_2026-02-14.json`
  - Observed: `agent_fallback == true`, `top_results == []`
  - Root error captured: `agent_error == "cannot import name 'genai' from 'google' ..."`

- **Receipt (PMID existence / title check):** `Tumor-Board/artifacts/receipt__pubmed_32661420_2026-02-14.json`
  - Observed: PMID `32661420` exists but is **not** an MBD4 immunotherapy paper.

### 1.4 Audit verdict (as of 2026-02-14)
- **C1**: **Partially supported** (bundle shows MBD4 detected; citations list empty for IO drugs).
- **C2**: **Not proven** (bundle lacks TMB; no hypermutation metric computed).
- **C3**: **Contradicted** (PMID `32661420` is a condensin cryo-EM paper; not MBD4/IO).

### 1.5 Missing fields / next proofs
- Need a receipt that either:
  - confirms PMID exists + relevance (literature endpoint / PubMed query), or
  - computes a proxy hypermutation signal from MBD4 signature (requires an implemented engine feature).

## 2) Opportunity 2 — Resistance Prophet pre-treatment baseline

### 2.1 Claims (from opportunities doc)
- **C1**: “Resistance Prophet shows ‘insufficient data’ because Ayesha is treatment-naive.”
- **C2**: We could compute a pre-treatment resistance risk profile (HR restoration / MAPK escape / ABCB1 upregulation etc.)

### 2.2 Runtime reproduction (this audit)
- **Receipt (gene toggles simulation):** `Tumor-Board/artifacts/receipt__ayesha_resistance_simulate_gene_toggles_mbd4_tp53_2026-02-14.json`
- **Observed behavior (runtime):**
  - `prediction.risk_level == "NOT_APPLICABLE"`
  - `prediction.probability == 0.0`
  - `prediction.prognosis.rationale[0]` explicitly states pre-treatment skip (validated post-tx only)
  - A single action is returned: `recommended_actions[0].action == "ESTABLISH_BASELINE"`
  - The signal list includes:
    - `CA125_KINETICS` marked insufficient due to needing ≥2 points
    - `GENE_LEVEL_RESISTANCE` containing an **MBD4 sensitivity marker** (“BER deficiency → PARP trapping”)

**Important note (engine contract):** `/api/ayesha/resistance/simulate` uses `gene_toggles` to construct simulated mutations; it does **not** consume an arbitrary `mutations` array from the request body.

### 2.3 Bundle alignment (payload-only)
- The tumor-board bundle does NOT include resistance-prophet output fields; it only includes `tests_needed` that mention CA-125 baseline and HRD/TMB/RNA.

### 2.4 Audit verdict (as of 2026-02-14)
- **C1**: **Contradicted by runtime** (engine returns NOT_APPLICABLE rather than “insufficient data” as a final status).
  - Reality: it *does* explicitly skip (pre-treatment) and requests baseline establishment.
- **C2**: **Not implemented** in current engine behavior (no pre-treatment risk forecasting; outputs are intentionally suppressed).

### 2.5 Missing fields / next proofs
- Decide if we want an explicit “pre-treatment forecast” mode (new contract) vs current skip behavior.

## 3) Opportunity 3 — BER pathway deep dive (DDR subcomponents)

### 3.1 Claims (from opportunities doc)
- **C1**: “We have DDR = 0.88 on mechanism vector, but all DDR genes treated equally.”
- **C2**: Propose splitting DDR into HRR/BER/NER/MMR components; BER=1.0 (MBD4 loss), HRR=0.0, etc.

### 3.2 Bundle alignment (payload-only)
- **BER is explicitly broken**:
  - `levels.L1.synthetic_lethality.broken_pathways[?pathway_id=="BER"].status == "non_functional"`
  - `...genes_affected includes "MBD4"`
- **No “DDR = 0.88 mechanism vector”** is present in this bundle:
  - Efficacy pathway scores show only `tp53: 0.4` (`levels.L1.efficacy.pathway_scores`)
  - SAE mechanism vector is not included in this L1 payload.

### 3.3 Runtime reproduction (this audit)
- **Status:** Not reproduced (no runtime receipt yet computing an HRR/BER/NER/MMR vector).

### 3.4 Audit verdict (as of 2026-02-14)
- **C1**: **Not supported** by tumor-board bundle (the numeric DDR=0.88 isn’t present here).
- **C2**: **Conceptually consistent** with current SL output (BER broken), but **not implemented** as a surfaced sub-vector.

---

## 4) Opportunity 4 — CA-125 KELIM forecasting (pre-treatment)

### 4.1 Claims (from opportunities doc)
- **C1**: Previously “can’t forecast without baseline value.”
- **C2**: With CA-125=2,842 U/mL we can set cycle milestones (cycle3 <854, cycle6 <284).

### 4.2 Runtime reproduction (this audit)
- **Receipt:** `Tumor-Board/artifacts/receipt__ca125_intelligence_baseline_inference_2026-02-14.json`
- **Observed behavior (runtime):**
  - `burden_class == "EXTENSIVE"`
  - `forecast.baseline_inferred_from_current == true`
  - `forecast.cycle3_expected_value == 852.6`
  - `forecast.cycle6_expected_value == 284.2`

### 4.3 Audit verdict (as of 2026-02-14)
- **C1**: **Resolved** (engine now supports pre-treatment milestone targets by inferring baseline from first value).
- **C2**: **Proven** (numbers align to the opportunity doc’s targets within rounding).

## 5) Opportunity 5 — PARP + ATR combination rationale (Ayesha-specific)

### 5.1 Claims (from opportunities doc)
- **C1**: “Resistance Playbook recommends PARP+ATR, but doesn’t explain why for Ayesha.”
- **C2**: Mechanistic story: MBD4 (BER deficiency) + TP53 (checkpoint failure) → dependence on ATR checkpoint; PARP+ATR doubly lethal.
- **C3**: Trials: NCT04284969, NCT02655016

### 5.2 Bundle alignment (payload-only)
- SL bundle does encode **exactly the two broken pillars**:
  - BER broken via MBD4: `levels.L1.synthetic_lethality.broken_pathways[BER]`
  - checkpoint compromised via TP53: `levels.L1.synthetic_lethality.broken_pathways[CHECKPOINT]`
- SL bundle also encodes **ATR as an essential backup** with explicit lineage boost language:
  - `levels.L1.synthetic_lethality.essential_pathways[?pathway_id=="ATR"].description` includes “DepMap lineage grounding … +0.15 confidence boost.”
- SL recommended drugs include both:
  - ATR inhibitor (`Ceralasertib`) confidence 0.85
  - PARP inhibitor(s) (e.g., `Olaparib`) confidence 0.7
  - `levels.L1.synthetic_lethality.recommended_drugs[*]`

### 5.3 Runtime reproduction (this audit)
- **Trial presence check receipt (our trials pipeline):**
  - `Tumor-Board/artifacts/receipt__ayesha_trials_search_nct_presence_2026-02-14.json`
  - Result: Neither `NCT04284969` nor `NCT02655016` appeared in returned `nct_ids` for Ayesha’s search request in this environment.

### 5.4 Audit verdict (as of 2026-02-14)
- **C1**: **Partially supported** (bundle proves ATR and PARP are both recommended, but does not generate a dedicated “combo rationale” narrative).
- **C2**: **Partially supported** (the pathway logic is present; the “PARP+ATR is better” comparative claim is not computed as such).
- **C3**: **Not supported by our current trials index** (runtime receipt shows those NCT IDs were not returned by `/api/ayesha/trials/search` under the Ayesha-like request used).

---

## 6) Opportunity 6 — HRD score prediction from MBD4

### 6.1 Claims (from opportunities doc)
- **C1**: HRD score unknown today.
- **C2**: We could estimate HRD range from MBD4 loss (35–55) with medium confidence.

### 6.2 Bundle alignment (payload-only)
- Bundle explicitly flags HRD missing:
  - `levels.L1.completeness.has_hrd == false`
  - `levels.L1.completeness.missing includes "HRD score"`

### 6.3 Runtime reproduction (this audit)
- **Status:** Not reproduced (no HRD estimator output exists in receipts).

### 6.4 Audit verdict (as of 2026-02-14)
- **C1**: **Proven** (bundle says HRD missing).
- **C2**: **Not implemented / not proven** (no estimator receipts).

---

## 7) Current “what’s real today” map (tumor-board aligned)

### 7.1 What is proven by bundle receipts (already shipped for tumor board)
- **SL logic is working for MBD4+TP53** (BER broken + checkpoint compromised → essential backups + recommended drugs).
- **Efficacy ranking exists but is limited** (L1 cap + missing coords for MBD4 indel and PDGFRA in WIWFM path).
- **Tests needed list is explicit** (HRD, TMB, RNA, CA-125).

### 7.2 What is proven by runtime receipts (this audit)
- **CA-125 pre-treatment milestones are now computed** via baseline inference.
- **Resistance Prophet currently skips pre-treatment** and returns NOT_APPLICABLE, requesting baseline establishment.

---

## 8) Next proofs to run (to finish auditing the remaining claims)

- **Evidence/PMID validation for Opportunity 1** (needs a deterministic receipt: PMID existence + retrieval path).
- **Trial-ID verification for Opportunity 5** (NCT checks + whether our trials pipeline surfaces these).
- **Any implemented BER-subvector / HRD estimator outputs** (if they exist, capture receipts; if not, mark “not implemented”).
