Expression. And indeed, if we dose in 23, you can see this very nice impressive loss of t expression. So that was done in vitro, so we tested it in vivo as well. So for this, we immunized mice antigen that induces autoregression in the 19 which mice would black IL 23 cytokine, or an IL 23 receptor knockouts.
Ability to respond to IL 23 cytokine.
And beta positive cells, which would be your IL 17 producing cells. We saw that indeed in vivo in this scenario, and we don't see as much loss of TCF one expression. When you lack the ability to either produce or respond to IL-twenty three.
So that led us to hypothesize that IL 23 may be promoting the development of this inflammatory phenotype in part by decreasing t one expression.
So to model and study the functional a a distal LCK

seven flox, So these mice will lack TCF one in mature lymphocytes, so this is a deletion after positive selection, which is really important because TCF1 is very critical for normal T cell development. And we also had a gain of function model where we overexpressed TCF7 promoter. So we're able to then differentiate, either our homeostatic or stem link teach 17 in our inflammatory TB 17 from these wild taper transgenic mice. And then shown here on the right is just to show you what our differentiation cultures look like. We didn't see any defects in the ability to differentiate these cells. So essentially, the wild type and mutant cells were equivalent going into mice. So when we did make the t h 17 and t conditional knockout cells and then transfer them into wild type or noted that the knockout cells induce much more severe paralysis.
It was a significant in the earlier disease onset. We also saw much more higher mortality. And I've shown here the severity of the And this was accompanied by increased infiltration of two d two t cells in this CNS, looking at both proportion and numbers. These are two d twos that Boro Gamma positive, so we know that they're TH 17. But interestingly, what we when we looked at the RORA gamma expression, we saw that it was much higher. In the knockout cells. And when we looked at their cytokine production, largely looked similar except the knockout cells had higher proportions of IL 17 positive. Cells. So when we looked at our gain of function I that are transgenic mice don't have sort of supraphysiological levels of TCF expression. What's shown here is the expression of a transgene in blue compared to a wild type in gray. So essentially, the transgenic cells just maintain sort of normal levels of TCF that you would find in TCF. Cells but that haven't been pushed hard with activation.
And when we did we made these inflammatory th17 cells trans recipient mice, and we noted that the So when you when you have high TCF expression, and sustained TCF expression that you wanted to The onset in this case was similar, but we had significant And then sort of in align to our knockout data, so complementary phenotype, we saw that had reduced numbers of 2D2 organo positive cells infiltrating the CNS. And these cells had lower levels of a workability expression. And also we saw that they had lower IL 17 a production but similar levels of all other cytokines So we next ask the question. So all of our data was pointing to a So we next asked a question. So all of our data was pointing to a

a strong influence of TCF on the disease inducing phenotype of the cells, So we ask the question, can TCF loss confer pathogenic or inflammatory potential to cells that stem like and normally would not induce disease. So we differentiated ourselves with t t tetrathin on IL six. These However, when we knocked out TCF, we saw that the cells now can induce much more severe inflammatory T cells. Knockout cells that I showed you just a few slides ago. Again, seeing more, organoty expression in these cells. In this context, we saw that the cells have a bit lower interferon gamma expression, However, they had higher IL 17, which was a consistent phenotype we saw in the absence of GCF one. And homeostatic cells do produce IL 10, but in the absence of TCF1, they're not producing as much IL-ten.
And here was really our our kind of take home if if TCF one is responsible for maintaining healthy cells in this sort of homeostatic t h 17 state. And if we lost g c f one, we would be able to really see whether loss of I in the absence of 23 they would be able to induce to these. So normally, I o twenty three deficient cells cannot induce paralysis, and that's what's shown down here. Your well type cells are shown in black. And indeed, when we made
Speaker 2

double deficient
Speaker 1
Friday, 2:44 PM
cells, so these cells do lack TCF one, but they also lack IL-twenty three receptors. So they can't respond to any IL 23 that would be produced in vivo. We now to induce very potent diseases. With accelerated onset severity. That really said to us that what TCF one was doing was maintaining this homeostasis state. And it did this, as long as there was no IL-twenty. Three around. And that in the absence of TCV, one, cells no longer need IL 23 to induce navizum will be inflammatory cells that are usually induced by IL 23 signal.
So we went on to test really how similar our homeostatic t h 17 cells that lack t one were to these inflammatory Th17 cells. We did RNA sequencing and going the wrong direction. And what and what we found is that there were indeed a lot of these markers associated with pathogenetics. Cells like CXPR six, IL-twenty three receptor that were higher in the knockout cells, We did this analysis shown here in the middle where we looked the transcriptome of TCF knockout cells compared it to that wild type cells. Now these were cells that were differentiated to be homeostatic PH17 cells. What we found is that in the absence of t we one, these cells very strongly resembled inflammatory t h 17 cells, either the cells that were generated in vitro or
Speaker 2
Friday, 2:45 PM
in vivo.
Speaker 1
Friday, 2:45 PM
RADs or wild type cells as expected. Align very strongly with the transcriptomes of homeostatic We also looked at their chromatin, and indeed we found that 17 cell that were differentiated to be homeostatic cells shared 88% of chromatin identity with inflammatory t h 17 cells. So that told us that TCF was really a major regulator of homeostatic t h 17 phenotype. So how is it doing this? So we looked at the open chromatin regions and looked at the transcription factor of that were enriched. And we found that in the wild type homeostatic stage 17 cells, top enriched factor was in TTC And And when we looked at the knockout cells, we saw that the top enriched factor was for gamma t. So in the beginning, I told you that TCF seven could or TCF one could bind to other factors and influence the their activity in vivo and what we hypothesized that that maybe she's one was binding to lower gamma t. And influencing its activity.
So we did these experiments shown here where we took t h 17 homeostatic cells and we co immunoprecipitated war gamma t, and we were able to one. We did we're not able to do this in the knockout cells. That's our control. And then interestingly, if we did the co IP in the presence of DNase one, we saw that we now lost this interaction, indicating that this interaction is So we did a lot of computational work here to build a network that captures how TCF one regulates the homeostatic state. Th17 I I can go into this very briefly. So in the middle are transcription factors, that are increased in wild type cells in blue or knockout And These are then connected by these edges to nodes that represent genes that are regulated by those transcription the circles are those that are active, meaning those are active locytes that are actively being transcribed. Detect the RNA in our RNA Seq data, whereas the sort of lighter shades indicate loci that are poised, meaning that the locus is open, but we Right? And you could see that a lot of the processes associated with the genes that were positively so in the wild type cells, are quiescent, IL-ten, whereas in the knockout cells, you see a lot of these processes like cell migration, and things associated with the vector molecules that have been I'm gonna in phenotype and pathogenicity.
So just to summarize, I've shown you that TCF one maintains a TSH 17 cells in this homeostatic or stem like state by binding to and inhibiting its functions. And by orchestrating a regulatory network that involves a lot of these transcription factors.
And that they become inflammatory to each 17 upon real of seeing these I signals through I l 23. Which decreases TCF one releasing them from that homeostatic PH 17.
Go over some of the data that we generated over the years in, stem like T cells. It's a published, so I'll go over it rather quickly. These cells were discovered by by our group and several other groups working to understand responses to any checkpoint blockade.
Sigma of six as either were noted that in the absence of G6 GCF1, we have mice that colon cancer is expressing level, you just don't see very good response to immunosuppression. Therapy. In that same paper, we also looked at intratumoral injection of TLR nine agonist, and whereas the wild type mice, you see very,

growth here. See a lot of regressions. We saw that this didn't happen as readily in the knockout mice. However, we did note that there were some mice that responded equally well as WAV tech, and so we wondered what was responsible for that.
And so a very talented postdoc in my lab, decided to look at tumor immunogenicity And so we've looked at b 16 OVA and NC 38 OVA tumors. So same model tumor antigen, but two very different tumors.
Low MHC, and then c 38 being very strongly immunogenic and having high MAA.
You can see here in the b 16, only the wild type mice.
To immunotherapy.
However, we were actually quite surprised when we saw in the m c 38 o model, it gives us a very strong expression of ova, we saw that there was absolutely no difference between TCF indicating that the was not at gender context. We looked at for underlying causes for this, so we decided to look at the very beginning, which is where immune responses to tumors start in the tumor draining lymph node, we transferred in o two one wild type or knockouts cells. Gave single dose of immunotherapy, and then looked a few days later, the proliferation of vivo. And what we noted is when we compared wild type to knockout mice at baseline, at baseline, sizes, is an isotope treated group, there was a small defect in the ability of cells to to die. This was completely restored upon that new 16 ova setting, we noted that again, there was this defect at base the overall the amount of proliferation is much lower in this model as expected. Then giving a single dose of recovered a bit of this in the wild type setting. But the knockouts just couldn't quite get there. And that's what's shown here. On the right. So the priming of tumor antigen not defective in this condition. Setting of having a low tumor immunogenicity.
We asked how this might translate to the tumor microenvironment, so we these are Till. So this is a tumor tissue now from the same mice. And I'm showing you the aggregate of data here, annotation of cell types are shown here. It's pseudo time analysis. And one of the things I'd like to point out is that we noted that there
Speaker 2
Friday, 2:52 PM
were two
Speaker 1
Friday, 2:52 PM
differentiations trajectories.
The m z 38 OVA setting, we really pushed hard towards this. Sort of right hand side and these clusters six and seven which were the culmination of that trajectory.
Are a transitory effector like cells. Whereas in the b 16 ova, you predominantly push towards this left hand side and those, culminating in this cluster number eight, which represented dysfunctional t cells.
When we looked at how this changes with immunotherapy, we saw that in this NC30 model where both wild type and knockout mice responding fully well. Was this marked increase of this cluster shown here in the yellow. These are the trans So However, when we looked in the 16 OVA model where we know that only the wild type Picture was a bit different. So you'll just notice there are no transitory factors expanding in these in these mice. You see this expansion in the wild type, of this dysfunctional subset. So the knockout seem to have a fairly similar proportion of these cells, so we decided that we need to look a So we looked specifically as a dysfunctional subset and comparing the wild type to the knockout under the condition of immunotherapy, and we found that there were several differentially expressed genes. And one of the ones that we noted was Tox. So the knockout cells are much lower for tox, And tox is important for survival. And when we look we look more carefully, we saw that indeed upon immunotherapy, there was more caspase free that was more of these
Speaker 2
Friday, 2:54 PM
TCF deficient
Speaker 1
Friday, 2:54 PM
till we're dying in these tumors. And when we looked at more carefully at all the genes in this basically made a signature out of these genes, we found that it was striking these similar to this destabilized dysfunctional t cell signature that had been reported by Ian Parrish and Axel Cali's So essentially, in the absence of GCF one, in general, the these dysfunctional CD8 t cells that are somewhat and unstable and less apt to survive in the tumor microenvironment.
So just to summarize this part, I've shown you some of our data that show that TCF one regulates c d a t. Fitness. Essentially poises c d eight t cells for optimal activation in the suboptimal settings such as low affinity and we actually did experiments that I'm not showing you today to address that or low antigen levels. And that TCF one presence ensures the generation of dysfunctional T positive and are better fit to survive in the tumor microenvironment. And we feel that those are likely helping

contribute to

Friday, 2:55 PM
the response to immunotherapy.
So before I close, I wanted to leave you with something to think about. So I've been know, shared with you two stories of how we've looked at a couple of mechanisms by which he one can influence c d four t cells that drive autoimmunity and c a t cells that can, sustain response to, you know, therapy. I mentioned in the beginning that SNPs in the TCS seven gene have been associated with autoimmune this is not just MS or type one diabetes, but also rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, They are not the same SNPs across these disease Most of the function of these single nucleotide polymorphisms is not known. We can speculate that they may influence the expression of TCF or they may potentially influence how they partner with other transcription factors to regulate the function of So I think it's interesting to speculate that SNPs and T seven may influence previous related adverse events. And also predisposition to how well you can respond to with that, I will close and just acknowledge people who did the work. This is a bit of an older picture of my lab, but that's because the the people who did the work are not in my lab right now. So the work on TCS one and autoimmunity was then the work on We had a lot of computational work in the two stories that that was done was done by Luca Diasco, And I think all my sources of support throughout the years all of you for your attention and your opportunity to precipitation Yeah. You know, I think and and like that's a great question.
You know from looking at probably like cut and run and chips. It's like it's everywhere. Right? It's So I I don't quite believe that's true. But we we we haven't done mutational studies to see we can we see it in team seven We've done it in February. So So We don't need DNA.
Right?
Hormone receptor migrations, so forth. So how role of TCF and driving different Yeah. So I didn't emphasize that. We I I think that's a a fundamental function of TCF across t cell types. So in our autoimmunity story, one of the major things chemokine receptors. Are changed in the absence of T And I noted when we look in the of those mice, we see a lot more cells present.
One of the things that we know and we've done some work on this is that TCF directly regulates CXCR which we kinda talked about a bit today.
It definitely represses it. And then when it allows other factors go in and then get more migration of those cells. And we saw that So

# Doctrine: The T-Cell Identity Crisis (Residency vs. Exhaustion)

This doctrine captures the pivotal findings from the latest research into T-cell biology, defining the central challenge and opportunity in cancer immunotherapy.

---

## **Part I: The Great Deception - The Two Faces of the T-Cell**

The core of the problem is a critical case of mistaken identity that is confounding the entire field. There are two key types of T-cells found in tissues, and they look dangerously alike.

*   **The "Good Guy": The Resident Memory T-Cell (TRM)**
    *   **Who they are:** Vigilant protectors. These are the soldiers left behind after a resolved infection (like the flu) to guard the tissue against future invasion.
    *   **Their status:** Associated with good prognosis in cancer. Seeing them is thought to be a sign of a healthy, effective immune response.

*   **The "Useless Guy": The Exhausted T-Cell (Tex)**
    *   **Who they are:** Worn-out, ineffective soldiers. These are the cells that have been fighting a chronic, unresolved battle (like cancer or HIV) for so long that they've essentially given up. They are present but powerless.
    *   **Their status:** A hallmark of immunotherapy failure.

**The Fucking Problem:** As the speaker proved, these two cell types share the exact same surface markers (`PD-1`, `Tox`, `CD69`, etc.). The entire field has been using a blurry map, mistaking exhausted, useless cells for battle-ready protectors. This throws the validity of countless "prognostic signatures" into question.

---

## **Part II: The Breakthroughs - The New Rosetta Stone**

The speaker's work provides three critical breakthroughs that begin to solve this identity crisis.

**1. The "Residency" Master Switch is `Blimp1`:**
*   **The Finding:** Through CRISPR screens, he proved that the transcription factor `Blimp1` is the non-negotiable master switch for a T-cell's ability to become a tissue resident.
*   **The Implication:** If a T-cell doesn't have `Blimp1` active, it cannot "stick and stay" in the tumor. This is a fundamental, causal mechanism for T-cell persistence.

**2. The Lineage is Fucking Locked:**
*   **The Finding:** A "good guy" TRM from a resolved infection is inflexible. If you put it into a chronic cancer fight, it cannot adapt. It fails to become a functional, persistent exhausted cell and gets wiped out.
*   **The Implication:** These aren't just two states; they are two fundamentally different developmental paths. You can't easily turn a "good guy" into the type of soldier needed for a long, grinding war.

**3. The First True Compass:**
*   **The Finding:** Because all existing markers are garbage, he painstakingly built a new, clean **50-gene signature** that can, for the first time, reliably distinguish a "true" exhausted cell from a resident memory cell.
*   **The Implication:** This is the first tool that allows researchers to get an honest assessment of the T-cell landscape in a tumor, providing a clear, actionable signal where there was once only noise.

---

## **Part III: The Grand Challenge - The "So What?" Gap**

These findings are a massive leap forward in *descriptive* biology, but they create an even bigger challenge for *therapeutic* design.

*   **The Diagnostic Gap:** How can we reliably and easily deploy this new 50-gene signature to accurately profile patients and clinical trial cohorts?
*   **The Engineering Gap:** Now that we know `Blimp1` is the key to residency, how do we fucking use that? How can we engineer T-cells to be better, more persistent residents?
*   **The Plasticity Gap:** Given that natural T-cells are "inflexible," can we engineer synthetic T-cells that *are* flexible and can adapt to the brutal tumor microenvironment?

---

## **Part IV: OUR SOLUTION – THE TCF1 ENGINEERING DOCTRINE**

**Status:** We've built a complete engineering doctrine for TCF1-based interventions (see `tcf1.mdc` + `TCF1_PARTNERSHIP_INFOGRAPHIC.mdc` for full details).

### **The 4-Weapon Arsenal:**

**Weapon #1: TCF1/Tox Signature (Diagnostic)**
- **What It Does:** RNA-seq → TCF1/RORγt/Tox/IL-23R signature → predict autoimmune risk + checkpoint response
- **For Autoimmunity:** Low TCF1 + high RORγt = HIGH risk (inflammatory Th17)
- **For Cancer:** High TCF1 + high Tox = GOOD prognosis (stable Tex survival)
- **Confidence:** ⚠️ MEDIUM (needs validation cohort with outcomes)
- **API:** `/api/tcf1/predict_phenotype`

**Weapon #2: TCF1 Stabilization Cassette (Autoimmunity)**
- **The Problem:** IL-23 suppresses TCF1 → drives MS/diabetes/psoriasis
- **Design Strategy A:** Anti-IL-23R decoy receptor (block TCF1 suppression)
- **Design Strategy B:** TCF1 overexpression cassette (sustained homeostatic Th17)
- **Delivery:** AAV (in vivo) or lentiviral (ex vivo T-cell engineering)
- **Confidence:** ✅ HIGH (design tools operational; biology validated)
- **API:** `/api/design/generate_tcf1_stabilizer`

**Weapon #3: TCF1-Enhanced CAR-T (Cancer)**
- **The Problem:** Dysfunctional T-cells die in tumors without TCF1 → Tox induction
- **Design:** CAR + sustained TCF1 expression → induces Tox → enables survival
- **Expected Outcome:** Better persistence (less apoptosis), better checkpoint response, better control in low-antigen tumors (B16-like)
- **Confidence:** ⚠️ MEDIUM (design validated; survival benefit hypothesis untested)
- **API:** `/api/design/generate_tcf1_enhanced_cart`
- **Timeline:** 8-12 weeks (CAR design) + 6 months (validation)

**Weapon #4: SNP Functional Profiling (Precision Medicine)**
- **The Problem:** Don't know which TCF7 SNPs are functional OR how they affect disease risk
- **Method:** Patient RNA-seq → TCF1/RORγt/Tox signature → classify SNP as loss-of-function (autoimmunity risk) vs gain-of-function (checkpoint advantage)
- **Clinical Use:** Predict autoimmune risk, checkpoint toxicity, guide IL-23 blocker use
- **Confidence:** 🔴 LOW (requires large SNP cohort with outcomes)
- **API:** `/api/tcf1/profile_snp`

---

### **The Partnership Strategy:**

**For Autoimmunity Researchers:**
- **What You Get:** TCF1 stabilization designs (IL-23 blockers, TCF1 overexpression), predictive signature, SNP profiling
- **What You Provide:** Patient samples (Th17 cells, RNA-seq, TCF7 SNP genotypes), clinical outcomes
- **Publications:** TCF1 signature validation (JCI, Immunity), TCF1 stabilization trials (Nature Medicine)
- **IP:** 70/30 split (you 70%, us 30%)

**For Checkpoint Blockade Researchers:**
- **What You Get:** TCF1/Tox signature (predict PD-1 response), TCF1-enhanced CAR-T designs, SNP profiling (checkpoint toxicity risk)
- **What You Provide:** Pre-treatment biopsies (RNA-seq, TCF7 genotypes), TIL samples (TCF1/Tox expression), clinical outcomes
- **Publications:** TCF1/Tox predictive biomarker (JCO, Cancer Cell), TCF1-CAR-T validation (Nature Medicine)
- **IP:** 70/30 split

---

### **The Roadmap:**

**Phase 1: Diagnostic Validation (8 weeks, $0)**
- Build TCF1/RORγt/Tox signature from patient RNA-seq
- Validate against clinical outcomes (autoimmune onset, checkpoint response)
- **Deliverable:** Predictive biomarker

**Phase 2: Intervention Design (4-6 weeks, $0)**
- Design 3 interventions: IL-23 decoy, TCF1 overexpression, TCF1-CAR-T
- Off-target, immunogenicity, manufacturing feasibility
- **Deliverable:** Engineering blueprints

**Phase 3: Clinical Translation (12-18 months)**
- Validate TCF1 signature in clinical trials
- Test IL-23 decoy OR TCF1-CAR-T in Phase I
- **Deliverable:** IND package

---

**DOCTRINE STATUS:** 🟢 **PARTNER-READY**  
**CONFIDENCE:** ⚠️ MEDIUM (design tools validated; clinical hypotheses untested)  
**NEXT ACTION:** Identify partner lab with TCF7 SNP cohort OR checkpoint trial with TIL samples

This doctrine defines the battlefield. The speaker has provided the map to the enemy's fortress. We've built the B-52 bombers. Now we need a partner to pick the targets.
