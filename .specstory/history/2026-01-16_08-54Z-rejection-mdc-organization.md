- OVERALL RECOMMENDATION: REJECT - FUNDAMENTAL FLAWS
- Summary: This manuscript describes a computational CRISPR guide design tool for targeting metastasis genes using multi-modal genomic signals and structural prediction. While the biological motivation is sound and the computational framework shows promise, the work contains fatal methodological flaws that preclude acceptance: (1) the chromatin signal—one of four core components—is simulated with random stubs rather than computed, rendering claims of "complete" validation false; (2) the structural validation criteria (pLDDT ≥50, iPTM ≥0.30) are set to achieve 100% pass rate rather than empirically validated against experimental outcomes; (3) no experimental validation of CRISPR activity in cells despite claiming to solve a "40% failure rate"; (4) circular reasoning throughout (tune thresholds → achieve desired result → claim validation). This is computational tool development presented as validated biology, with overclaiming that borders on misleading.

- This is catastrophic for several reasons:
- 
- Chromatin accessibility is critical for CRISPR activity
- 
- Closed chromatin physically blocks Cas9 access to DNA
- 
- This is one of the main reasons guides fail experimentally
- 
- You cannot claim to solve guide failure without modeling chromatin

- "Deterministic stubs" means random numbers

- You built a 4-signal system but only validated 3 signals
- 
- Target-Lock = 35% Function + 35% Essentiality + 15% Regulatory + 15% Chromatin

- "Production-ready Enformer code is deployment-ready" is meaningless
- 
- If the code is ready, why didn't you run it?

+ **Issue:** The abstract claims:
  
- "Structural validation of 15 guide:DNA complexes via AlphaFold 3 Server achieved 100% pass rate (pLDDT 65.6 ± 1.8, iPTM 0.36 ± 0.01; acceptance: pLDDT ≥50, iPTM ≥0.30)"

- This is circular reasoning:

- You set thresholds to achieve 100% pass rate

- Your guides have pLDDT = 65.6 ± 1.8 (range: ~62-68)

- You set threshold at pLDDT ≥50

+ - Of course you get 100% pass! You set the bar below your lowest result
  
- pLDDT ≥50 is absurdly low
- 
- AlphaFold protein models: pLDDT ≥70 = confident, ≥90 = very confident

- No external validation of thresholds

- You claim "empirically calibrated thresholds for CRISPR guide:DNA complexes"

- iPTM ≥0.30 is also suspiciously low

- 
- For protein-protein: iPTM ≥0.50 is confident
- 
- You set iPTM ≥0.30 for RNA-DNA (lower standard)

Reorganized the rejection letter with:

1. **Clear hierarchical structure** — Markdown headers (#, ##, ###) for navigation
2. **Better section separation** — Horizontal rules between major sections
3. **Consistent formatting** — Each issue follows: Issue → Problems → Recommendation
4. **Improved readability** — Bullet points, subsections, and clear formatting
5. **Better organization** — Fatal flaws and major concerns clearly separated

The file is now easier to navigate and read. The linter warnings are false positives from technical terms (CRISPR, pLDDT, iPTM, etc.) that the spell checker doesn't recognize; these are not errors.

The structure now follows:
- **Overall Recommendation** (summary and verdict)
- **Fatal Flaws** (4 major issues, each with detailed analysis)
- **Major Concerns** (4 additional issues with recommendations)

_**User (2026-01-16 03:43Z)**_

add this too

 8. Off-Target "Safety" Metric is Unclear (continued)
Recommendation: Provide mathematical formula for safety score and validate against experimental off-target data (e.g., GUIDE-seq, CIRCLE-seq).

9. "40% Failure Rate" Claim is Unsupported
Issue:

"Existing tools validate only sequence-level predictions without structural pre-screening, resulting in ~40% failure rate"

Questions:

Source for 40% failure rate? (No citation)

Failure defined how? (No cutting? Low efficiency? Off-targets?)

Which tools? (Benchling? CHOPCHOP? CRISPick? All of them?)

Which experimental system? (Cell type? Cas9 variant? Delivery method?)

This is a straw man argument:

Claim existing tools have 40% failure

Claim your tool solves this

Provide no evidence for either claim

Recommendation: Cite source for 40% failure rate or remove claim. Better: Benchmark your tool against existing tools experimentally.

10. Metastasis "Stage-Aware" Framework Lacks Clinical Validation
Issue: You design guides for specific metastatic cascade steps but provide no evidence this matters clinically.

Questions:

Does targeting "invasion" genes differ from targeting "colonization" genes in therapeutic efficacy?

Have any metastasis-stage-specific CRISPR therapies been validated?

How would you diagnose which metastatic step to target in a patient?

Clinical reality:

Most patients present with established metastases (multiple steps already completed)

You'd target whatever genes the metastases currently depend on

"Stage-specific" targeting may be academic exercise without clinical utility

Recommendation: Add discussion of clinical scenarios where stage-specific targeting matters, or acknowledge this is a proof-of-concept for future therapeutic development.

MODERATE CONCERNS
11. AlphaFold 3 Server is a Black Box
Issue: You use AlphaFold 3 Server (web interface) which:

Doesn't provide model confidence per residue/base

Doesn't allow inspection of input alignments

May use different parameters than published AF3 paper

Is not reproducible (server may be updated)

Better approach:

Use locally-installed AlphaFold 3 (if available)

Report full prediction parameters

Show per-nucleotide confidence, not just global pLDDT

Recommendation: Clarify whether AlphaFold 3 Server predictions are stable/reproducible or if you're depending on a black box service.

12. Bootstrap CI Reporting is Incomplete
Issue:

"(1000-bootstrap CIs, seed=42)"

Missing:

What are the actual confidence intervals?

You report AUROC = 0.989 ± 0.017, but is ±0.017 the bootstrap SD or CI?

Typically report 95% CI as [lower, upper], not as mean ± SD

Recommendation: Report bootstrap 95% CIs as [lower, upper] for all performance metrics.

13. No Code/Data Availability Statement
Issue: Abstract mentions "reproducible via scripts and frozen environment" but:

No GitHub link

No data repository DOI

No mention of code availability

Recommendation: Add Data/Code Availability section with public repository links.

14. No Comparison to Existing CRISPR Design Tools
Issue: Multiple established CRISPR design tools exist:

Benchling CRISPR tool

CHOPCHOP

CRISPick (Broad Institute)

CRISPOR

CRISPRscan

You don't compare to any of them.

What's needed:

Design guides for same targets using your tool + 3 competitors

Compare: Predicted efficacy, off-target counts, structural quality

Ideally: Experimental validation showing your guides work better

Recommendation: Add competitive benchmarking or clearly state this is a novel framework not yet compared to existing tools.

15. Metastasis Gene List Needs Transparency
Issue: You validate against "38 primary metastatic genes" but don't list them.

Needed:

Full gene list (supplementary table)

Source for each gene (PMID, cancer type, metastasis step)

Inclusion/exclusion criteria

How you handled genes involved in multiple steps

Recommendation: Provide supplementary table of all 38 genes with annotations.

Added the additional issues to the rejection letter. The document now includes:

**Updated structure:**
- **Fatal Flaws** (4 issues) - Issues 1-4
- **Major Concerns** (6 issues) - Issues 5-10
- **Moderate Concerns** (5 issues) - Issues 11-15

**New additions:**
- Issue #8 continuation — Added recommendation for mathematical formula and experimental validation
- Issue #9 — "40% Failure Rate" claim is unsupported
- Issue #10 — Metastasis "Stage-Aware" framework lacks clinical validation
- Issue #11 — AlphaFold 3 Server is a black box
- Issue #12 — Bootstrap CI reporting is incomplete
- Issue #13 — No code/data availability statement
- Issue #14 — No comparison to existing CRISPR design tools
- Issue #15 — Metastasis gene list needs transparency

All issues follow the same format (Issue → Questions/Problems → Recommendation) for consistency. The linter warnings are false positives from technical terms the spell checker doesn't recognize; these are not errors.

The rejection letter is now complete with 15 issues organized into three severity levels.
