## **CURRENT AGENT STATUS**

AGENT 1 (PREVIOUS - THERAPY FIT VALIDATOR):
  Deliverable: ✅ Comprehensive Therapy Fit validation plan
  Status: COMPLETE (7 pathways × 10+ cancers strategy)
  Mission: Validate WIWFM (drug efficacy predictions)
  Timeline: Ready to execute Week 3-4
  Owner: Can be Agent 3 or separate agent

AGENT 2 (ENGINEER - RESISTANCE PROPHET INFRASTRUCTURE):
  D0: ✅ COMPLETE (TCGA lacks CA-125, PLCO identified)
  D1: ✅ COMPLETE (PLCO application submitted)
  D2: ⏸️ PENDING (Proof-of-path for multi-modal logic)
  D3: ⏸️ PENDING (Validation harness)
  D4: ✅ COMPLETE (Validation protocol already exists)
  Status: Waiting on PLCO approval
  Mission: Build kinetics validation infrastructure

AGENT 3 (SCIENTIST - VALIDATION ROADMAP):
  S1: ✅ COMPLETE (Gap analysis - excellent work)
  S2: ⏳ IN PROGRESS (Pathway-kinetic matrix, 6 hours)
  S3: ⏸️ PENDING (Priority hypotheses, depends on S2)
  S4: ⏸️ PENDING (Data source mapping - CRITICAL)
