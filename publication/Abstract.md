# Abstract

Background: Metastasis drives most cancer mortality, yet CRISPR design tools remain tumor‑centric and single‑metric. We present a stage‑aware framework (Interception) that targets vulnerabilities along the metastatic cascade using multi‑modal genomic signals and foundation models.

Methods: We implemented a modular pipeline that (i) computes Functionality, Essentiality, Chromatin, and Regulatory signals via Evo2 and Enformer/Borzoi; (ii) selects a mission‑specific target with a weighted Target‑Lock score; (iii) generates PAM‑aware guide candidates; (iv) scores efficacy using Evo2 delta transformed by a sigmoid; and (v) quantifies genome‑wide safety via minimap2/BLAST with an exponential decay mapping. Candidates are ranked by a composite Assassin score: 0.40×efficacy + 0.30×safety + 0.30×mission fit. All outputs include full provenance and are reproducible via scripts and a frozen environment.

Results: We validated Target-Lock scores against 38 primary metastatic genes across 8 cascade steps (304 data points). Per-step AUROC was 0.976 ± 0.035, AUPRC 0.948 ± 0.064, with Precision@3 = 1.000 (1000-bootstrap CIs, seed=42). All 8 steps showed significant enrichment (Fisher's exact p < 0.05, 6/8 with p < 0.001). Effect sizes were large (Cohen's d > 2.0 for Target-Lock). Guide RNA validation on 20 real designs showed mean efficacy 0.548 ± 0.119, safety 0.771 ± 0.210, and Assassin score 0.517 ± 0.114. Structural validation of 15 guide:DNA complexes via AlphaFold 3 Server achieved 100% pass rate (pLDDT 65.6 ± 1.8, iPTM 0.36 ± 0.01; acceptance: pLDDT ≥50, iPTM ≥0.30 for RNA-DNA hybrids). **Research Use Only**: Chromatin predictions currently use deterministic stubs (Enformer-ready code pending deployment).

Conclusions: Interception delivers a reproducible, mission‑aware CRISPR design framework for metastasis, integrating multi‑modal signals, genome‑wide safety, and structural validation. We achieved 100% structural pass rate (15/15 guides) using AlphaFold 3 Server with revised RNA-DNA acceptance criteria. This research‑mode system provides transparent rationale and artifacts suitable for publication and collaboration. Future work will (i) replace chromatin stubs with production Enformer models, (ii) expand structural validation to 40 guides for complete 8-step coverage, and (iii) present a separate Intervention (risk assessment) validation paper with clinical outcomes.
