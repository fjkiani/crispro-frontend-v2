  3. Decision gates (proceed/pivot/pause)
  4. Next week priorities

WEEK 1 (Dec 30):
  Agent 2: D3 harness progress
  Agent 3: S2 completion + S4 started
  Decision: Monitor PLCO approval

WEEK 2 (Jan 6):
  Agent 2: PLCO approval status + A1-A3 plan
  Agent 3: S4 complete, collaborator outreach started
  Decision: Execute PLCO validation OR continue waiting

WEEK 3 (Jan 13):
  Agent 2: PLCO kinetics results (if approved)
  Agent 3: Collaborator responses, DUA negotiation
  Decision: Start WIWFM validation (Agent 1)

WEEK 4+ (Jan 20+):
  Track 1: PLCO report finalized
  Track 2: Treatment cohort status
  Track 3: WIWFM validation progress
  Decision: Prioritize RP vs WIWFM completion
```

## **RISK MITIGATION**

RISK 1: PLCO approval delayed (>7 days)
  Mitigation: Agent 3 accelerates S4 (external data sources)
  Backup: Project Data Sphere, Vivli, YODA platforms
  Timeline impact: +2-4 weeks

RISK 2: PLCO kinetics fail (AUROC <0.60)
  Mitigation: Honest assessment, learn from failure
  Pivot: Focus on WIWFM (proven), await treatment cohort
  Timeline impact: None (WIWFM ready to execute)

RISK 3: Treatment cohort access denied
  Mitigation: Multiple collaborators contacted (5-10)
  Backup: Synthetic CA-125 for proof-of-concept only
  Timeline impact: +4-8 weeks (try alternative sources)

RISK 4: Agent bandwidth constraints (2 parallel tracks)
  Mitigation: Sequential execution (WIWFM in Week 3)
  Prioritization: RP infrastructure first, WIWFM second
  Timeline impact: +2-3 weeks (sequential not parallel)

RISK 5: Holiday delays (New Year's week)
  Mitigation: Expect Jan 2-6 for approvals
  Use wait time: Build harness, execute S4
  Timeline impact: Already accounted for
