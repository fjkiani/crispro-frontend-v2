# The Two‑Hit Hypothesis & RUNX1 in Leukemia — A Digestible In‑Silico Playbook (RUO)

## TL;DR
- The two‑hit hypothesis says disease often needs a “driver” plus a cooperating event.
- In leukemia, RUNX1 disruption is a common first hit; cooperating lesions (e.g., TP53/17p, ASXL1, FLT3) or supportive niches help disease progress.
- Our in‑silico Co‑Pilot turns this biology into clear steps: understand the first hit, anticipate the second, and propose a design or therapy plan — fast, explainable, and shareable (RUO).

## Context — What the two‑hit hypothesis means here
- First hit (driver): RUNX1 alteration (missense, nonsense, frameshift, splice) impairs hematopoietic differentiation and regulation.
- Second hit (cooperation): another lesion (e.g., TP53/17p, ASXL1, FLT3‑ITD/MAPK) or microenvironmental support enables expansion, survival, and resistance.
- Implication: to change the trajectory, you must understand both the driver pathway burden and the cooperating vulnerabilities.

## Our RUO, SOTA‑grounded approach (plain)
- We leverage state‑of‑the‑art building blocks (Evo2 for zero‑shot variant science; AlphaMissense coverage where applicable) and wrap them into a conservative, explainable flow with provenance (run IDs, profiles, citations).
- Research‑mode (RUO): clear labels, transparent confidence, and ready‑to‑share Dossiers — not a medical device or clinical claim.

## What you get in minutes (modules)
- Variant Insight (VUS): simple chips (Function, Regulatory, Essentiality, Chromatin) + one‑pager.
- Pathway View: top pathways driving biology; one‑line “why” + therapy alignment hint.
- Therapy Fit (Chemo): ranked drug classes with confidence, rationale, citations.
- CRISPR Readiness: on‑target feasibility, access, off‑target preview (demo), delivery notes (demo).
- Clinical Trials Co‑Pilot: shortlist with Likely/Potential/Unlikely and a shareable one‑pager.
- Evidence & Knowledge Base: citations, badges, helper text, and provenance across views.

## SOTA foundations we stand on (research)
- Evo2 paper: zero‑shot state‑of‑the‑art on noncoding/regulatory; competitive coding performance with long‑context biology. We reuse those strengths for insight chips and pathway context.
- AlphaMissense: strong missense prior used in Fusion profile when eligible. We keep Baseline deterministic and label Fusion clearly.

## A realistic success bar (what numbers we target, RUO)
- Variant classification: AUROC ≥ 0.90 on curated RUNX1‑relevant sets (goal for internal research; claims not clinical).
- Therapy Fit stability: consistent ranked classes across repeats; confidence shifts when evidence/cohort supports.
- CRISPR readiness (demo now → deeper later): high on‑target feasibility for candidate sites; low preliminary off‑target preview counts; provenance on all outputs.
- Trials matching: top‐N (e.g., ≤10) relevant trials with clear eligibility labels in minutes; exports available.

## The in‑silico plan for RUNX1 (step‑by‑step)
1) Predict the first hit (RUNX1) impact
   - Use VUS Explorer chips and Pathway View to quantify RUNX1 functional burden and pathway effects (hematopoietic differentiation/DDR context).
   - Attach citations; record run ID and profile.
2) Anticipate the second hit (cooperation)
   - Scan typical co‑lesions in leukemia (e.g., TP53/17p, ASXL1, FLT3‑ITD/MAPK). Use Pathway View + Knowledge Base to surface likely cooperating axes.
   - Produce a concise hypothesis: “Driver: RUNX1; Cooperation: TP53/17p or MAPK/FLT3; microenvironment supportive.”
3) Propose the intervention path
   - Therapy Fit (Chemo): rank classes aligned to pathway burden; add confidence, rationale, citations.
   - CRISPR Readiness (design path):
     - Option A (repair): consider correction of pathogenic RUNX1 (HDR path – roadmap for scoring).
     - Option B (eliminate second hit): design guides to target the cooperating lesion (e.g., FLT3‑ITD locus) — show feasibility, access, off‑target preview (demo), and delivery notes (demo).
4) Clinical Trials Co‑Pilot
   - Provide a shortlist with Likely/Potential/Unlikely and a short “why,” then export a one‑pager.
5) Dossier (the blueprint)
   - Bundle all of the above into a clean, shareable Dossier (variants, chips, ranked therapies, trials, citations, confidence, run IDs) for wet‑lab planning or trial screening.

## How we would validate success (RUO)
- Design a small, pre‑registered internal protocol:
  - Inputs: curated RUNX1 cases with known co‑lesions and outcomes.
  - Measures:
    - Insight calibration: chips correlate with known driver/cooperation labels.
    - Therapy Fit sanity: on biology‑aligned cases, top classes match expected MoA.
    - Trials: time‑to‑shortlist and proportion labeled “Likely/Potential” that agree with clinician review.
    - CRISPR (demo now): feasibility metrics logged; later augmented with bench‑ready scoring.
  - Reporting: provenance (run IDs), profiles (Baseline/Richer/Fusion), and exports attached to each case.

## FDA perspective (RUO, hypothetical)
- We keep a research‑mode posture; no clinical claims. However, the Dossier and provenance make our outputs “inspection‑ready” as a blueprint for wet‑lab and trial teams.
- As we accumulate evidence (internal benchmarks, cohort overlays, literature strength), we can shape a path toward the kinds of evidence dossiers that regulators expect — faster and more structured than manual approaches.

## Why this raises the bar
- Speed: minutes to a credible, shareable starting point (not weeks).
- Clarity: plain chips, ranked therapies, and one‑pagers with sources.
- Reuse: knowledge base, trials, and evidence stitched together with run IDs.
- Traction: a blueprint Dossier that accelerates wet‑lab and clinical planning.

## Call to action (research)
- Bring a RUNX1 case (or small cohort). We will produce the Dossier within hours: chips, pathway view, ranked therapies, trial shortlist, and a CRISPR readiness snapshot — with confidence, citations, and run IDs.
