# From Genome to Game Plan: An A–Z Story of Confidence for Oncology R&D

If you work in oncology R&D, you carry two pains: too many options and not enough certainty. We built an in‑silico copilot that takes genomic reality and turns it into a clear plan: which medicines make the most biological sense, how confident we are, and what to do next. This isn’t a feature list; it’s a new way to run R&D.

## Who this is for
- Translational scientists making therapy calls from sequencing reports
- Computational biologists who need transparent, reproducible signals
- Program leads who must prioritize trials, experiments, and budgets

## The three questions every team must answer
1) What in the tumor actually matters? (signal vs noise)
2) Does a medicine target that biology? (mechanism alignment)
3) How sure are we? (confidence you can defend)

## Plain‑language 101

### Gene essentiality (will the cell care if we hit this?)
Some genes are “plumbing”—break them and the cell fails. Others are cosmetic. Essentiality asks: if we disrupt this gene (by mutation or by therapy), how much does the cell’s survival depend on it? We analyze the sequence change in context and map it to an essentiality score with confidence, so you know if a target is truly consequential.

### Efficacy (is this medicine a good biological fit?)
Efficacy here means “fit for this biology.” We look at what’s broken (sequence) and where it lives (pathways), then line that up with how a drug works (mechanism of action). The output is a ranked list of therapies with an efficacy score and a confidence score, plus a short explanation you can read.

### Resistance vs sensitivity (what will likely push back—or respond?)
Variants can make cells sensitive to certain drugs—or resistant. We track signals that point in either direction (for example, pathway rewiring that blunts a drug’s effect). Results show up as evidence badges and rationale so you can see both sides: why something might work, and why it might not.

## What the product actually is
An in‑silico R&D copilot that converts raw variants into a therapy game plan with confidence and provenance. It outputs structured JSON that any team can render, export, or drop into a dossier. Every number has a reason; every lift in confidence leaves a paper trail.

You get:
- A ranked therapy table: efficacy (fit), confidence, tier (supported/consider/insufficient), and badges (e.g., on‑label, pathway‑aligned)
- Four compact insights: Function, Regulatory, Essentiality, Chromatin—what changed and why it matters
- A short rationale you can paste into a deck
- Provenance: run ID, profile, and which signals/lifts were used

## What this translates to in real work
- Trial strategy notes: why a class belongs on your short list (or not)
- Experiment plans: which assays are worth running first, and why
- Dossier excerpts: a transparent rationale you can defend with stakeholders
- Faster reviews: the same JSON powers your UI and your memos

## Use‑cases (A–Z)

### Multiple Myeloma (MM)
- Start with known SOC (proteasome inhibitors, IMiDs, Anti‑CD38) clearly labeled and prioritized
- If RAS/MAPK signaling is disrupted, MAPK‑aligned therapies move up—with the confidence and rationale to explain why
- Essentiality and regulatory signals frame whether a target is consequential or peripheral

### Melanoma
- BRAF/NRAS/KIT contexts translate into a pathway‑aware view of targeted options vs combinations
- Resistance flags (e.g., pathway bypass) surface in the rationale so you can design smarter combinations or sequence therapies

### Ovarian
- HRD and pathway context highlight DNA‑repair‑aligned options, with confidence explained in plain English
- Where evidence is thin, the output stays honest—no false promises, just the next best experiments

## Why this is a disruptor (without the buzzwords)
- Transparent confidence: we don’t hide how we reached a number. You see the reasons, thresholds, and toggles.
- Mechanism‑first: therapies are ranked by biological alignment, not popularity.
- Reproducible by design: every run is tagged; results are consistent under the same profile.
- Built for action: outputs double as experiment plans and briefing notes.

## A short story from our smoke test
We began with low confidence—too many weak signals and a muted pathway readout. We fixed the pathway mapping, added honest, small lifts where appropriate (standard‑of‑care labels, cohort context, calibration), and made sure every change left a receipt. Confidence rose to a level you can discuss in a team meeting—and defend. Still RUO, still transparent, now far more useful.

## What this means for your R&D cadence
- Fewer dead‑ends: cut low‑yield hypotheses earlier
- Shorter loops: move from sequencing → decision → experiment faster
- Clearer reviews: stakeholders see the same evidence you do, in the same language
- Better budgets: spend on the ideas with the strongest biology and clearest rationale

## Guardrails and posture
This is research‑use only. Confidence depends on inputs and coverage; when evidence is thin, we say so. Where labels (e.g., on‑label status) are inferred from curated tables, we keep them conservative and traceable.

## How to get started
Bring a variant. We’ll run it live, read the output together, and turn it into a concrete plan: which medicines to prioritize, which experiments to run, and how confident to be at each step.
