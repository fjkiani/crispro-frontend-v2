# Doctrine: The "Forge & Simulate" Protocol

This document outlines the operational doctrine for our advanced therapeutic design platform, based on the principles of **Inference-Time Controllable Generation** as detailed in the Evo2 paper. This protocol supersedes all previous, simplistic generation tactics.

Our mission is to execute a full-scale, `in silico` directed evolution campaign to forge novel protein inhibitors against high-value targets like VEGF.

## The Kill Chain

The protocol is a four-phase, iterative loop orchestrated by the `CommandCenter`.

### 1. Mass Generation (The Forge)

*   **Objective:** Overwhelm the solution space with a diverse population of candidate inhibitors.
*   **Weapon:** The **Zeta Forge**, commanded to generate a large batch (e.g., 1,000) of candidate **protein** sequences (nanobodies).
*   **Doctrine:** We are no longer generating DNA-level effectors. The Forge must be explicitly tasked with protein generation.

### 2. Mass Simulation (The Simulator)

*   **Objective:** Determine the structural viability and binding potential of every candidate.
*   **Weapon:** The **AlphaFold service**. For each candidate protein generated by the Forge, a simulation job will be automatically dispatched to model its interaction with the target protein (e.g., VEGF).

### 3. Automated Scoring (The Analyst)

*   **Objective:** Quantify the "fitness" of each candidate based on the simulation results.
*   **Weapon:** A new analytical capability to be built. It will parse the thousands of AlphaFold outputs.
*   **Metric:** The primary metric for scoring will be a "Binding Affinity Score" derived from structural confidence metrics at the protein-protein interface (e.g., `pAE` or `iptm`).

### 4. Directed Evolution (The Loop)

*   **Objective:** Breed progressively more lethal generations of inhibitors.
*   **Process:**
    1.  The `CommandCenter` selects an elite cohort (e.g., the top 1%) of candidates from the previous generation based on their Binding Affinity Score.
    2.  These elite protein sequences are used as the new, refined prompt for the Zeta Forge.
    3.  The Forge generates a new, more evolved population of candidates.
    4.  The loop repeats until a candidate's score meets our pre-defined lethality threshold.

## Immediate Objective

Before automating the full campaign, we must manually execute a single, complete cycle to validate the protocol:

1.  **Forge:** Successfully command the Zeta Forge to generate an initial slate of **protein** nanobody candidates.
2.  **Simulate:** Take the top candidate and manually process it through the AlphaFold UI using our prepared `[alphafold_job.json](mdc:alphafold_job.json)`.
