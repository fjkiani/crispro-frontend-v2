PRIORITY 2: D3 - Phase 1B Validation Harness
  Owner: Agent 2
  Timeline: 8-12 hours (next week, Jan 2-6)
  Why: Ready for PLCO data when approved
  Output: Kinetics validation pipeline (KELIM, models, metrics)

PRIORITY 3: Phase 1A Execution (WIWFM Validation)
  Owner: Agent 1
  Timeline: 2-3 weeks (Jan 17 - Feb 7)
  Why: Can execute NOW with available data
  Output: Pathway alignment validation (DDR → PARP, MAPK → MEK)

PRIORITY 4: S2 - Pathway-Kinetic Matrix
  Owner: Agent 3
  Timeline: 6 hours (after S4 complete)
  Why: Informs S3 (hypotheses) but not blocking
  Output: 20-30 pathway-kinetic pairs from literature

PRIORITY 5: Phase 1B Validation (PLCO Kinetics)
  Owner: Agent 2
  Timeline: 1-2 weeks (Jan 10-17, if PLCO approved)
  Why: Proves kinetics layer (stepping stone to Phase 1C)
  Output: AUROC 0.60-0.70 for onset detection

## **WHAT S1 TELLS US ABOUT SUCCESS CRITERIA**

S1 DEFINED SUCCESS FOR EACH PHASE:

PHASE 1A (Baseline-only):
  Success: AUROC 0.55-0.65 (baseline risk stratification)
  Not success: Claiming "early detection" (misleading)
  Output: "MAPK mutations are prognostic, not predictive of timing"

PHASE 1B (Kinetics-only):
  Success: AUROC 0.60-0.70 (kinetics predict outcomes)
  Not success: Claiming "resistance detection" (wrong cohort - PLCO is onset)
  Output: "CA-125 kinetics detect cancer onset, not treatment resistance"

PHASE 1C (Multi-modal):
  Success: AUROC 0.65-0.75 (earlier than either alone)
  Lead time: 3-6 weeks before imaging progression
  Output: "MAPK + CA-125 detects resistance week 6-9, imaging shows week 12-18"

PHASE 2 (ctDNA added):
  Success: AUROC 0.70-0.80+ (mechanistic resistance)
  Output: "Restoration/escape detected at molecular level before clinical symptoms"

HONEST REPORTING:
  If Phase 1A only: "Baseline risk stratification (not early detection)"
  If Phase 1B only: "Kinetics proven for onset (not resistance)"
  If Phase 1C: "Multi-modal early resistance detection validated"
  If Phase 2: "Mechanistic resistance detection with genomics"
