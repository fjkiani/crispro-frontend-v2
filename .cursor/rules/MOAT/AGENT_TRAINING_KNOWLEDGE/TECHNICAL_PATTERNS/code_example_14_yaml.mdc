  ✅ Cancer outcomes (72 incident cancers)
  ✅ Large cohort (78,000 women)

BUT:
  ⚠️ Screening cohort (healthy → cancer onset)
  ⚠️ NOT treatment cohort (diagnosed → resistance)
  ⚠️ Different biological question

WHAT PLCO PROVES:
  ✅ CA-125 kinetics work for ONSET detection (Layer 2 signal validated)
  ✅ Infrastructure works (harness, KELIM computation)
  ✅ Stepping stone to treatment cohorts

WHAT PLCO DOESN'T PROVE:
  ❌ MAPK + CA-125 for RESISTANCE detection (wrong cohort)
  ❌ Adaptive resistance timing (no treatment context)
  ❌ Clinical utility for Resistance Prophet (different endpoint)

VERDICT:
  PLCO = Proof-of-kinetics (valuable, but not final validation)
  Treatment cohort = TRUE validation (S4 must find this)

## **S1 VALIDATION STRATEGY → CURRENT EXECUTION MAP**

### **S1 Proposed 3 Phases:**

PHASE 1A: Baseline-only (MAPK/PI3K/DDR)
  Goal: Baseline risk stratification (NOT early detection)
  Data: TCGA-OV mutations + platinum response ✅ HAVE
  Expected: Modest AUROC (~0.55-0.65)
  Status: ✅ CAN EXECUTE NOW (this is WIWFM territory)
  Owner: Agent 1 (Therapy Fit validation)

PHASE 1B: Kinetics-only (KELIM replication)
  Goal: CA-125 kinetics predicts outcomes
  Data: Serial CA-125 + outcomes ⏳ PLCO PENDING
  Expected: AUROC 0.60-0.70 (kinetics alone)
  Status: ⏳ WAITING ON PLCO APPROVAL (Jan 2-6)
  Owner: Agent 2 (Engineer - harness + validation)

PHASE 1C: Multi-modal (MAPK + CA-125)
  Goal: EARLIER detection than either alone
  Data: Baseline MAPK + serial CA-125 + resistance outcomes
  Expected: AUROC 0.65-0.75 (combined signals)
  Status: ❌ NEED TREATMENT COHORT (S4 must acquire)
  Owner: Agent 3 (Scientist - data source mapping)

PHASE 2: Add ctDNA (restoration/escape)
  Goal: Mechanistic resistance detection
  Data: Longitudinal genomics + CA-125 + outcomes
  Expected: AUROC 0.70-0.80+ (full multi-modal)
  Status: ❌ LONG-TERM (4-8+ months to acquire)
  Owner: Future work
```
