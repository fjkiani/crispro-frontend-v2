## Business Value – Slide Template and Copy

Use this to build an investor‑ready slide that explains why CrisPRO matters commercially and strategically.

### Slide Structure
- Title: “Business Value: From Hypothesis to Guidance”
- Subtitle: “Faster decisions, transparent evidence, lower cost of development”
- 4 blocks: Market Gaps, Our Approach, Industry Impact, Competitive Advantages
- Optional footer: Revenue model and moats (one‑liners)

### Copy Blocks (ready‑to‑paste)

#### Market Gaps
- Drug development decisions rely on fragmented evidence and slow manual synthesis.
- Variant‑level guidance is spotty; noncoding and context effects are underused.
- Existing tools optimize old drugs’ timing rather than inventing new precision therapies.
- Reproducibility and provenance are rarely first‑class; audit trails are weak.

#### Our Approach
- Unified S/P/E framework: Sequence, Pathway, Evidence – fused into one guidance score.
- Live insights with full provenance: every number is traceable, exportable, and repeatable.
- Profiles for stability and lift: Baseline (1B, safe), Richer S (bounded), Fusion (AM‑covered).
- Research‑mode by design: cohort‑dependent, conservative gates, and transparent confidence.

#### Industry Impact
- Accelerates hypothesis → validation by surfacing ranked, auditable options in minutes.
- Reduces cost of exploration: safer defaults, toggleable lifts, and deterministic runs.
- Enables portfolio triage: compare profiles side‑by‑side and focus on high‑signal programs.
- Unlocks partner workflows: cohort extraction, benchmarks, and exportable artifacts.

#### Competitive Advantages
- Fused signal with AM prior on missense variants – clearer decisions where coverage exists.
- Transparent by default – run IDs, citations, and rationale on every output.
- Modular orchestration – endpoints for insights, efficacy, datasets, and guidance.
- Pragmatic infrastructure – spam‑safe flags, 1B default, and graceful degradation.

### Revenue Model (one‑liners)
- Platform royalty: 2–5% on licensed IP where platform contributes materially.
- Co‑inventor ownership: 10–30% where novel designs originate from the platform.
- Service + royalty hybrid: upfront for patent workflows plus ongoing royalty.

### Moats (one‑liners)
- Technical: contribution tracking, calibration, provenance.
- Legal: co‑invention doctrine and royalty infrastructure.
- Business: flywheel from more users → more IP → more royalties.

### Slide Checklist
1) Keep claims investor‑friendly; avoid unverifiable metrics.
2) Mention research‑mode and cohort dependence explicitly.
3) Show 1–2 profile toggles if space allows (Baseline vs Fusion).
4) End with a concrete partner outcome (faster, cheaper, traceable decisions).
