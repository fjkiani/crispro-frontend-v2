# DOCTRINE: The Truth or Treason Protocol

This protocol is our definitive, three-phase assault plan for establishing biological truth and demonstrating the unquestionable superiority of our platform. We do not merely publish findings; we deliver receipts.

## Phase I: Intelligence Gathering (The ZSIS Protocol)

**Objective:** Deconstruct a vague enemy claim (e.g., "shark cartilage cures cancer") into a precise, testable, and falsifiable scientific hypothesis.

**Execution:**
1.  Identify the core biological claim.
2.  Isolate the specific protein/gene target (e.g., MMP-9).
3.  Isolate the specific effector molecule (e.g., Protein "U-995").
4.  Formulate the final hypothesis: "Molecule X inhibits Target Y to produce Effect Z."

## Phase II: The Gauntlet (Define the Kill Shot)

**Objective:** Quantitatively prove the ineffectiveness of the enemy's weapon and establish the benchmark for a perfect kill shot.

**Execution:**
1.  **Test Their Weapon:** Run the enemy's effector molecule (e.g., U-995 protein) through the **Zeta Oracle** to get its Zeta Score. This score, which will be pathetically close to zero, is proof of its failure.
    *   **Key Endpoint:** `/api/oracle/calculate_zeta_score`
    *   **Example Result:** `Zeta Score: -0.0000622` (A blank round).
2.  **Define Victory:** Run an *in silico* knockout of the target gene itself. The resultant catastrophic negative Zeta Score is the **"Maximum Impact Score"**—the quantitative definition of a 100% effective weapon.
    *   This score becomes our absolute benchmark for success.

## Phase III: The Forge (Demonstrate Superiority)

**Objective:** To not just debunk a myth, but to solve the problem on the spot, forging a new, superior therapeutic weapon.

**Execution:**
1.  **Counter-Command:** The CommandCenter issues a directive to the Zeta Forge.
    *   **Key Endpoint:** `POST /api/forge/generate_inhibitor`
2.  **Unleash the Forge:** This endpoint awakens our most powerful weapon. It runs an iterative "generate-and-test" loop, commanding our generative AI (Evo2) to create thousands of potential new protein inhibitors and simultaneously commanding our Zeta Oracle to score each one against the target.
3.  **Forge the Superior Weapon:** The Forge does not stop until it has created a weapon with a catastrophically negative Zeta Score that approaches our "Maximum Impact Score."
4.  **Deliver the Receipt:** The protocol concludes with a final, damning dossier: *"The enemy weapon is a failure (Zeta Score: -0.0000622). In the time it took to prove that, we forged a new, superior weapon with a Zeta Score of -98.7. We have not just debunked your myth; we have solved your fucking problem. This is the receipt."*

### Technical & Strategic Precedents:
*   **The Forge Battle Plan:** The implementation details for the `/generate_inhibitor` endpoint are laid out in the `forge.py` plan. See: [forge.py](mdc:oncology-coPilot/oncology-backend/backend/api/forge.py)
*   **The Evo Service Deployment:** The architecture for a lightweight, asynchronous, and powerful generative Modal service is established in the `evo-service`. This is our technical template. See: [main.py](mdc:src/services/evo_service/main.py)

## **ADDENDUM 1: THE ZETA TRANSLATION ENGINE (FORGE-AND-ASSEMBLE PROTOCOL)**

**STATUS:** OPERATIONAL DIRECTIVE

The initial execution of the **Truth or Treason Protocol** was a success, but it revealed a tactical flaw in our manufacturing process. **The Forge** delivered a weapon's core components (a raw DNA sequence), not a fully assembled weapon (a protein sequence). This is an unacceptable gap in our end-to-end doctrine.

The **Zeta Translation Engine** has been forged to close this gap. It represents the final stage of our automated assembly line.

The **"Forge-and-Assemble" Protocol** is now standing doctrine, upgrading **Phase III: The Forge**.

### **Upgraded Phase III Execution:**

1.  **Forge:** The Zeta Forge generates the novel DNA sequence as before.
2.  **Assemble:** The system immediately invokes the **Zeta Translation Engine** to translate the DNA blueprint into the final, combat-ready protein weapon.
3.  **Deliver the Biologic Blueprint:** The final output is no longer just a sequence, but a complete **Biologic Blueprint** containing both the `dna_sequence` and the `protein_sequence`.

### **NEXT STEPS: COMPLETE THE KILL CHAIN**

The backend systems have been upgraded and are pending deployment. The final step is to ensure our commanders in the field can view the complete intelligence picture.

*   **Task 2.2: Upgrade the Interception Design Studio UI.**
    *   **Action:** Modify the front-end application to display the complete **Biologic Blueprint**. The UI must present two distinct fields: "DNA Sequence (Genetic Blueprint)" and "Protein Sequence (The Final Weapon)".
    *   **Objective:** Provide commanders with total situational awareness of their forged assets, from genetic foundation to functional tool.

This is the final step to full operational capability. Execute.
