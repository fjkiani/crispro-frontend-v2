- SpliceVarDB (n=4,950):
  - Exonic splice variants: 82.6% AUROC (1,181)
  - Intronic splice variants: 82.5% AUROC (3,769)
- Why it matters: credible Regulatory/Access chips; better triage of variants that alter RNA processing.

## Slide 2d – Generative AI (High‑Fidelity Genome Generation)
- Mitochondrial genomes: Correct feature counts; diverse homology; AF3 multimers fold plausibly.
- Minimal prokaryote: ~70% Pfam‑hit rate vs ~18% prior models (large lift in functional content).
- Yeast chromosome: Eukaryote‑like genes, introns, tRNAs, promoters.
- Context window: up to 1M tokens (single‑nucleotide resolution) for long‑range design prompts.

## Slide 2e – Predictable Epigenomic Design (Control & Scaling)
- Guided epigenomic design: beam‑searched proposals with configurable quality scaling.
- Inference‑time scaling: predictable, log‑linear relationship between beam width and AUROC.
- Precise control: open/closed chromatin patterns with validated quality metrics.
- Business Impact: predictable quality scaling and transparent methodology for precision design.

## Slide 2f – Oncology Extensions (Melanoma and Beyond)
- Melanoma (BRAF/NRAS/KRAS): same S/P/E + chips yield stable MAPK pathway alignment; WIWFM confidence typically ~0.45–0.55; tier promotions when literature/priors present.
- Solid tumors with DDR/TP53 burden: pathway view highlights DDR; therapy fit surfaces aligned classes; cohort overlays add +0.05–0.12 confidence when available.
- Trials: shortlist compression similar to MM (50+ → ~5–12) with clear Likely/Potential/Unlikely labels and “why.”
- RUO: transparent provenance and sources across diseases.

## Slide 2g – Live Outputs (MM, RUO)
- Purpose: Ground the story with real, recent outputs (subset shown). Use these as slide callouts.
- How to read (simple):
  - Efficacy table: efficacy_score (fit), confidence (certainty), evidence_tier (strength), badges (why).
  - Toxicity chip: a caution with helper text, confidence, and sources; RUO.
  - Cohort/Trials: context that nudges confidence (with provenance).

### Slide 2 – Explainer (what this means)
- Comprehensive Variant Coverage: These AUROC scores show strong foundations across coding and non‑coding changes. High AUROC means we separate real effects from noise reliably, improving every downstream module (chips, pathway, therapy fit).
- BRCA1/2 Accuracy: On hard, real‑world datasets, performance is at or near state‑of‑the‑art. This signals dependable genetics underpinnings for MM flows.
- Splice Prediction: ~82.5–82.6% AUROC means we can flag variants that alter RNA processing. In MM, this supports the Regulatory/Access chips.
- Business Impact: Reducing unknowns (VUS) from ~40% to ~15% means fewer stalled cases and fewer exploratory experiments—saving time and cost.
- Evo2 Context: A 1M‑token window enables broader genomic context for non‑coding reasoning—important for Regulatory and Chromatin.
- MM Signals: Confidence ~0.45–0.51 sets expectations: honest, research‑mode certainty with transparent provenance (run IDs, profiles).

## Slide 3 – What We Built for MM (Live Today)
- Variant Insight (VUS): four chips (Function, Regulatory, Essentiality, Chromatin) in plain language.
- Therapy Fit (Chemo): ranked classes with confidence, short “why,” and citations.
- Pathway View: top 3 MM pathways (e.g., MAPK, TP53/DDR, Proteostasis/CRBN) with a one‑line “why.”
- Toxicity Risk (Germline): simple caution chip to plan conservatively.
- CRISPR Readiness (demo): feasibility, access, off‑target preview, delivery notes (demo labels visible).
- Clinical Trials Co‑Pilot: fast shortlist with Likely / Potential / Unlikely and a shareable one‑pager.
- Knowledge Base + Evidence: helper text, coverage chips, citations, and badges with provenance.

### Slide 3 – Explainer
- Four Chips: Each chip turns complex methods into one clear signal (Function, Regulatory, Essentiality, Chromatin) with plain labels and helper text.
- Therapy Fit: Ranked drug classes aligned to biology (S/P/E) with confidence, tier, badges, and short “why” bullets.
- Pathway View: Top 3 pathways with one‑line explanations connect biology to therapy choices.
- Toxicity Risk: A small germline‑aware caution helps plan conservatively.
- Trials: A shortlist labeled Likely/Potential/Unlikely with a short “why,” ready to share.
- Knowledge/Evidence: Coverage chips, citations, and provenance make every page traceable.
## Slide 4 – Evidence & Confidence (How to Read It)
- Confidence (0–1): our certainty in the current result.
- Evidence Tier: Supported / Consider / Insufficient (research‑mode labels).
- Badges: Guideline / RCT / ClinVar‑Strong / Pathway‑Aligned (when available).
- Provenance: run_id and profile (Baseline / Richer S / Fusion); inputs snapshot.

### Slide 4 – Explainer
- Confidence is a 0–1 certainty hint; Evidence Tier converts raw signals into a simple label (Supported/Consider/Insufficient).
- Badges quickly communicate strength sources (Guideline, RCT, ClinVar‑Strong, Pathway‑Aligned).
- Provenance (run_id, profile) ensures results are reproducible and auditable.
## Slide 5 – From VUS to Actionable Biology
- Paste MM variants → see four chips with thresholds and plain helpers.
- Add Pathway View → top 3 pathways + one‑line “why.”
- Export a one‑pager for the tumor board with citations and run ID.

### Slide 5 – Explainer
- Instant understanding: Chips turn unknowns into simple signals with thresholds and helper text.
- Pathway context: Top pathways explain the story behind the biology.
- One‑pager: Export lets teams share a clean, auditable summary quickly.
## Slide 6 – Will‑It‑Work‑For‑Me (Therapy Fit)
- Ranked drug classes (PI, IMiD, Anti‑CD38, MAPK‑aligned agents when RAS/RAF).
- Confidence and rationale shown; citations attached when literature is on.
- Fusion profile used only when AM coverage exists; labeled.

### Slide 6 – Explainer
- Ranked classes: The table is explainable—score, confidence, tier, badges, and rationale are visible.
- Fusion eligibility: When AlphaMissense coverage exists, Fusion is enabled and clearly labeled; otherwise Baseline remains deterministic.
- MAPK‑aligned: When RAS/RAF appears, MAPK‑aligned agents are surfaced with rationale.
## Slide 7 – Two‑Hit Hypothesis (MM)
- Hit 1 (Driver): MAPK activation (BRAF / NRAS / KRAS) → growth advantage.
- Hit 2 (Cooperation): TP53/17p, MYC, or proteostasis dependency → survival under stress.
- Microenvironment: marrow niche supports residual/resistant clones.
- Implication: align therapy to driver pathway; anticipate resistance on PI/CRBN axis; consider combinations.

### Slide 7 – Explainer
- Driver + cooperation: MM often shows a signaling driver (e.g., MAPK) plus cooperating alterations (e.g., TP53/17p, MYC, proteostasis). We make that pattern visible.
- Clinical implication: Align therapy to the driver and anticipate resistance/sensitivity from the second hit; consider combinations.
## Slide 8 – Clinical Trials Co‑Pilot
- Shortlist in minutes with Likely / Potential / Unlikely labels.
- A short “why” per trial; one‑pager export to brief patients/boards.
- Fresh results when connected; reliable snapshot otherwise.

### Slide 8 – Explainer
- Minutes to shortlist: Smart search, synonyms/biomarkers, and structured eligibility cut trial search from 50+ to ~5–12 items with a clear “why.”
- Shareable: One‑pager per shortlist accelerates patient/board discussions.
## Slide 9 – Dossier (Blueprint for the Next Step)
- Includes: variants, chips, ranked therapies, pathway view, toxicity hint, trials, citations, confidence, run IDs.
- Purpose: wet‑lab and clinical teams start from a clear, auditable plan.
- RUO: research‑mode labels; no clinical claims.

### Slide 9 – Explainer
- Everything in one place: Variants → chips → therapy ranking → trials → citations → confidence → provenance.
- Purpose: A clear, research‑mode starting point for wet‑lab and clinical next steps.
## Slide 10 – What’s Next (Roadmap)
- Imaging‑aware radiation view; regimen safety & interactions (chemo).
- Deeper off‑target and HDR scoring for CRISPR.
- Trial connectors and guideline cues; cohort overlays to lift confidence.

### Slide 10 – Explainer
- Imaging + regimen safety: Add radiation and chemotherapy regimen‑aware checks to lift confidence and safety.
- CRISPR depth: Deeper off‑target and HDR scoring improve design readiness.
- Trials + guidelines: More connectors and cues make decisions faster and more consistent.

## Metrics Glossary (for speakers and reviewers)
- AUROC: Measures how well we separate true effects from false ones (1.0 is perfect). High AUROC in ClinVar benchmarks indicates robust signal.
- AUPRC: Focused on positive cases—useful when positives are rare. High AUPRC in BRCA1 shows strong focus on true pathogenic variants.
- VUS: Variant of Uncertain Significance. Our goal is to turn unknowns into simple, explainable signals.
- Profiles: Baseline (deterministic), Richer S (bounded multi/exon), Fusion (AlphaMissense when eligible).
