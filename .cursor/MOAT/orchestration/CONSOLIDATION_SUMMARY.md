## ✅ Files Consolidated

### **Source Documents:**
1. **ORCHESTRATION_SCOPE_SYNTHESIS.md** → `01_CURRENT_STATE.md`
   - Current state, what's built, agent status
   - Completion status, dependencies map
   - What's next, recommended steps

2. **ORCHESTRATOR_DASHBOARD_VERIFICATION.md** → `02_FRONTEND_STATUS.md`
   - Component verification
   - Hooks & services verification
   - Dashboard structure
   - Gaps & missing features

3. **ULTIMATE_MOAT_ORCHESTRATION.mdc** → `05_MASTER_BLUEPRINT.md`
   - Master workflow (8 phases)
   - Complete MOAT stack
   - Agentic architecture
   - Event triggers

### **New Documents Created:**
1. **00_MISSION.mdc** - Mission, vision, architecture overview
2. **03_DELIVERABLES_PLAN.md** - Complete deliverables breakdown with priorities
3. **04_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md** - Phased implementation plan (4-6 weeks)

## 📋 Deliverables Defined

### **🔴 CRITICAL (Blocking):**
1. **Data Extraction Agent** (4-6 hours) - BLOCKING
2. **Drug Efficacy Integration** (8-10 hours) - Core drug ranking

### **🟡 HIGH PRIORITY:**
3. **Nutrition Integration** (4-6 hours) - MOAT feature
4. **Universal Pages Integration** (9-13 days) - Frontend integration
5. **Trigger System** (4-6 hours) - Event automation

### **🟢 MEDIUM PRIORITY:**
6. **Security & Compliance** (4-6 hours) - Production readiness

### **🔴 CRITICAL (Not Blocking):**
7. **Access & Advocacy Agent** (1-2 weeks) - Module 15
8. **Toxicity Risk Agent** (4-6 hours) - Module 16

**Total Estimated Time:** 4-6 weeks to MVP

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### **Immediate (Week 1):**
