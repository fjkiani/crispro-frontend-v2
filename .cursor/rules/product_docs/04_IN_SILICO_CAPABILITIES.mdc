# In‑Silico Capabilities – Doctrine (Website + Execution)

One place to keep labels, card content, evidence metrics, audiences, and quick links for all in‑silico modules. RUO by design.

## Card labels (use across pages)
- Core Capability: what it does in one line
- Evidence (core): Confidence (0–1) · Evidence Tier (Supported/Consider/Insufficient) · Sources (count + key refs) · Provenance (run_id, profile)
- Target Audience: who benefits and how in one sentence

## Available now (research‑mode)

### Variant Insight (VUS)
- Core Capability: Turn “unknowns” into plain signals with a one‑page summary
- Evidence (core): Confidence · Tier · Sources · Provenance
- Target Audience: Researchers/Clinicians – faster triage and a clear story to share
- Endpoint: [insights.py](mdc:oncology-coPilot/oncology-backend-minimal/api/routers/insights.py)
- Quick test:
```bash
curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/insights/predict_protein_functionality_change \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"gene":"TP53","variants":[{"gene":"TP53","hgvs_p":"R175H"}]}'
```

### Therapy Fit (Chemo)
- Core Capability: Ranked chemo classes with confidence, short “why,” and sources
- Evidence (core): Confidence · Tier · Sources · Provenance
- Target Audience: Medical Oncologists/Pharmacists – clearer shortlists
- Doctrine: [chemotherapy_copilot_concept.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/research/chemotherapy_copilot_concept.mdc)
- Endpoint: [efficacy.py](mdc:oncology-coPilot/oncology-backend-minimal/api/routers/efficacy.py)
- Quick test:
```bash
curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/efficacy/predict \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"mutations":[{"gene":"BRAF","hgvs_p":"V600E","chrom":"7","pos":140453136,"ref":"T","alt":"A"}],"disease":"multiple myeloma"}'
```

### Radiation Readiness
- Core Capability: Radiosensitivity and toxicity risk hints for planning
- Evidence (core): Confidence · Tier · Sources · Provenance
- Target Audience: Radiation Oncologists/Physicists – quick signals to align the team
- Doctrine: [precisionrad_copilot_concept.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/research/precisionrad_copilot_concept.mdc)
- Endpoint: [efficacy.py](mdc:oncology-coPilot/oncology-backend-minimal/api/routers/efficacy.py) + insights
- Quick test: see doctrine example (TP53 R175H)

### CRISPR Readiness
- Core Capability: On‑target feasibility, access, off‑target preview (demo), delivery notes (demo)
- Evidence (core): Confidence · Sources · Provenance
- Target Audience: Genome Engineers – faster kickoff with auditable snapshots
- Doctrine: [crispr_copilot_concept.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/research/crispr_copilot_concept.mdc)
- Endpoints: [design.py](mdc:oncology-coPilot/oncology-backend-minimal/api/routers/design.py), [insights.py](mdc:oncology-coPilot/oncology-backend-minimal/api/routers/insights.py)
- Quick tests: see doctrine (guide candidates, chromatin proxy)

### Evidence Intelligence
- Core Capability: Citations and badges with provenance for quick trust
- Evidence (core): Sources · Tier (when enabled) · Provenance
- Target Audience: All – clarity and trust in one view
- Endpoint: [evidence.py](mdc:oncology-coPilot/oncology-backend-minimal/api/routers/evidence.py)

### Cohort Context
- Core Capability: Small study extracts and baseline benchmarks to ground findings
- Evidence (core): Baseline AUPRC/AUROC + artifact link · Provenance
- Target Audience: Researchers/Institutions – reproducible context
- Endpoint: [datasets.py](mdc:oncology-coPilot/oncology-backend-minimal/api/routers/datasets.py)

### Pathway View
- Core Capability: Simple “what biology is driving this?” view tied to therapy choices
- Evidence (core): Sources · Provenance
- Target Audience: Clinicians/Researchers – quick mechanism alignment
- Implementation: part of [efficacy.py](mdc:oncology-coPilot/oncology-backend-minimal/api/routers/efficacy.py)

### Toxicity Risk (Germline)
- Core Capability: Simple side‑effect risk hints to plan conservatively
- Evidence (core): Confidence · Sources · Provenance
- Target Audience: Radiation/Medical Oncology – plan safer when hints are present
- Implementation: via insights + evidence where available

## Near‑term roadmap (keep labels ready)
- Imaging‑Aware Radiation: on‑treatment change detection and dose‑painting hooks
- Regimen Safety & Interactions: enrich chemo with interaction/toxicity checks
- Trial Readiness: curated guideline/on‑label signals and trial stubs
- Deeper Off‑Target & HDR (CRISPR): full search and scoring
- Radiomics: CT/PET/MRI feature integration

## Evidence (core) – card metrics (use everywhere)
- Confidence: 0–1
- Evidence Tier: Supported / Consider / Insufficient
- Sources: citations (count + key refs)
- Provenance: run_id and profile (Baseline/Richer/Fusion)
