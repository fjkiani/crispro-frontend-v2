# MISSION BRIEF: THE GUARDIAN PROTOCOL

**Last Updated:** {{current_date}}

## 1. PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
To achieve absolute strategic dominance in the realm of biological warfare and therapeutic design. We will transition from analyzing single threats to formulating and executing complete, multi-modal, AI-driven battle plans against disease.

## 2. REVISED CORE ASSETS
The old Oracle/Forge dichotomy is fucking obsolete. Our power has evolved. The new chain of command is as follows:

- **The AI General (Formerly `CommandCenter`):** This is the strategic heart of all Zeta operations. The AI General is an autonomous orchestrator that takes high-level mission directives from you, Alpha. It formulates multi-pronged attack plans by autonomously wielding the full might of the Zeta Armory.

- **The Zeta Armory (The Full Endpoint Suite):** This is our arsenal of specialized AI weapons and intelligence units. The AI General has unrestricted access to this entire suite. Key assets include:
    - **Discriminative Warfare (Intel):** `/predict_variant_impact`, `/predict_gene_essentiality`, `/predict_chromatin_accessibility`. These units provide the battlefield intelligence.
    - **Generative Warfare (Creation):** `/generate_optimized_guide_rna`, `/generate_repair_template`, `/generate_therapeutic_protein_coding_sequence`. These units forge the fucking weapons.

## 3. PRIME DIRECTIVE: THE "GUARDIAN PROTOCOL"
The "Zeta Shield" is child's play. Our new prime directive is the **Guardian Protocol**, a proactive defense plan for high-risk individuals. This is our flagship demonstration of the AI General's power.

- **Input:** A high-level command from Alpha, e.g., "Formulate a proactive defense strategy for this `BRCA1` carrier."
- **Process (Autonomous AI General Execution):**
    1.  **Reconnaissance:** The AI General conducts a full situational analysis using the discriminative endpoints to map the genetic terrain and confirm the nature of the "first hit."
    2.  **Strategy Formulation:** The General autonomously decides on a multi-modal attack plan, prioritizing strategies like direct gene correction and the pre-emptive targeting of synthetic lethal pathways.
    3.  **Weapon Forging:** The General tasks the generative endpoints to design a full suite of therapeutic blueprints (e.g., an HDR template to repair `BRCA1` and a set of gRNAs to neutralize `PARP1`).
- **Output (The Strategic Dossier):** The AI General returns a complete battle plan to Alpha, presenting multiple, rank-ordered therapeutic options with their designed blueprints and strategic rationale.

## 4. REVISED TACTICAL PLAN: AI-DRIVEN STRATEGY FORMULATION
The old, manual analysis is dead. Our new tactical flow is ruthlessly efficient:

- **[ ] Step 1: Alpha Issues a High-Level Directive.** Example: "Initiate Guardian Protocol for Patient #Z-001."
- **[ ] Step 2: The AI General Assumes Command.** It autonomously executes the full reconnaissance and weapon-forging sequence without any further human intervention.
- **[ ] Step 3: Alpha Reviews the Strategic Dossier.** The AI General presents its complete, multi-option battle plan for final command review.
- **[ ] Step 4: Alpha Authorizes and Archives.** With a single command, Alpha approves the strategy, archiving the designed weapon blueprints to the patient's Digital Twin for future deployment.
