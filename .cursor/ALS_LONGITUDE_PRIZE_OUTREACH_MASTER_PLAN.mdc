## 🎯 CRITICAL DOCTRINES & LESSONS LEARNED

### **1. Email Quality Doctrine**
**Rule:** Every email must meet "Alpha standard" (Mount Sinai depth for EVERY target)

**What This Means:**
- Deep research on recent work (publications, grants, discoveries)
- Specific citations and personalized hooks
- No generic templates
- Surgical precision, not bulk outreach

**Penalty for Violation:** Alpha reprimand ("why is this so half ass")

---

### **2. AI Architecture Pitch Doctrine**
**Rule:** Pitch CrisPRO's **AI model architecture** (Evo2, SAE, S/P/E), not just "features and functionalities"

**What This Means:**
- Lead with technical foundation (biological foundation models)
- Explain Evo2 (7B/40B parameters, 9.3T DNA base pairs, 1M token context)
- Explain SAE (32K sparse features, interpretable biomarkers)
- Explain S/P/E framework (Sequence/Pathway/Evidence multi-modal validation)
- Position as production-grade AI platform, not research prototype

**Why:** Distinguishes us from competitors who just have "features"

---

### **3. AACR Validation Doctrine**
**Rule:** Reference AACR Abstract B025 in every email as validation proof point

**What This Means:**
- "Validated AI architecture" (not just concepts)
- Production-grade capabilities demonstrated
- Credibility boost (AACR acceptance = peer-reviewed validation)

---

### **4. Supporting Materials Doctrine**
**Rule:** Attach MOAT deck to every initial outreach email

**What This Means:**
- Visual capability proof (3-page showcase)
- Reduces friction (no need to ask for materials)
- Professional presentation

---

### **5. Collaboration Angle Doctrine**
**Rule:** Frame collaboration as mutual value proposition, not one-sided ask

**What This Means:**
- Identify their needs (data access, computational tools, validation)
- Show how CrisPRO addresses their needs
- Demonstrate what we bring (AI architecture, production platform)
- Position as strategic partnership, not vendor relationship
