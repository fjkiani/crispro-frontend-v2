# Cohort Lab Frontend Guide (Jan 2025)

## Overview
The `CohortLab.jsx` component provides **interactive clinical outcome exploration** - users can preview labels, check class balance, and validate data quality before running full extractions.

## Key Features

### 1. Clinical Attributes Explorer
- Fetches available outcome attributes from cBioPortal
- Shows: DFS_STATUS, OS_STATUS, TREATMENT_OUTCOME, etc.
- Helps users understand what data exists

### 2. Label Preview (100 samples)
- Quick extraction to check class distribution
- Shows: Total, Positive %, Negative %, Balance status
- Color-coded: Green = balanced, Orange = imbalanced

### 3. Full Extraction with Outcomes
- Extracts cohort with real DFS/OS labels
- Downloads CSV/JSON with clinical fields
- Ready for ML benchmarking

## Component Location
`oncology-coPilot/oncology-frontend/src/components/ResearchPortal/CohortLab.jsx`

## User Workflow
1. Select disease & study (e.g., TCGA-OV)
2. Click "Fetch Available Attributes" → see DFS_STATUS
3. Click "Preview Labels" → verify 67% recurred / 33% censored
4. Click "Extract & Benchmark" → get full 500-row cohort
5. Download CSV with dfs_status, os_status, patient_id

## Technical Details
- Uses `/api/datasets/extract_and_benchmark` endpoint
- Mode "extract_only" for preview (100 samples)
- Mode "both" for full extraction + benchmark
- Label distribution computed client-side from preview data
