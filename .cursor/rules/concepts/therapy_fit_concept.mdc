# Therapy Fit – Drug Efficacy Ranking (S/P/E Framework)

## Core Capability

**Drug efficacy ranking using S/P/E framework:**
- **Sequence (S):** Evo2 adaptive multi-window scoring (30% weight)
- **Pathway (P):** Gene-to-pathway mapping with drug-pathway alignment (40% weight)
- **Evidence (E):** Literature search + ClinVar classification (30% weight)

**Formula:** `efficacy_score = 0.3 × Sequence_Percentile + 0.4 × Pathway_Percentile + 0.3 × Evidence_Strength + ClinVar_Prior`

## Output

Ranked drug list with:
- `efficacy_score` (0-1)
- `confidence` (0-1)
- `evidence_tier` (Supported/Consider/Insufficient)
- `badges` (RCT, Guideline, ClinVar-Strong, PathwayAligned)
- `insights` (functionality, chromatin, essentiality, regulatory)
- `rationale` (S/P/E breakdown)
- `citations` (literature PMIDs)
- `provenance` (run ID, profile, methods)

## Implementation

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/efficacy/predict`

**Location:**
- Orchestrator: `api/services/efficacy_orchestrator/orchestrator.py`
- Router: `api/routers/efficacy/router.py`
- Sequence: `api/services/efficacy_orchestrator/sequence_processor.py`
- Drug Scoring: `api/services/efficacy_orchestrator/drug_scorer.py`

**Example:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/efficacy/predict \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "mutations": [{"gene": "BRAF", "hgvs_p": "V600E", "chrom": "7", "pos": 140453136, "ref": "T", "alt": "A"}],
    "disease": "melanoma",
    "model_id": "evo2_1b",
    "options": {"adaptive": true}
  }'
```

## Evidence Tiers

- **Supported:** Strong evidence (≥0.7) OR ClinVar-Strong + pathway alignment
- **Consider:** Moderate evidence (≥0.3)
- **Insufficient:** Low scores (<0.3)

**Confidence:** Computed from tier, badges, and insights lifts

**Badges:** RCT, Guideline, ClinVar-Strong, PathwayAligned

## Insights Integration

**4 Chips with confidence lifts:**
- Functionality (threshold: 0.6, lift: +0.05)
- Chromatin (threshold: 0.5, lift: +0.04)
- Essentiality (threshold: 0.7, lift: +0.07)
- Regulatory (threshold: 0.6, lift: +0.02)

**Purpose:** Modest confidence boosts when biological signals align
