### The Problem:

- **PLCO:** Screening cohort (asymptomatic, no treatment yet)
- **Treatment cohort:** Patients on carboplatin/paclitaxel (active therapy)
- **These are fundamentally different populations**


### The Hard Question:

**How do we ensure validation is apples-to-apples when populations are different?**

**Concerns:**

- Screening: Baseline CA-125, no treatment effect
- Treatment: Serial CA-125 during therapy, treatment effect confounds
- Are we validating the same thing?


### My Answer (Attempt):

**Hypothesis:** We're validating DIFFERENT things:

- PLCO: KELIM predicts ONSET (baseline kinetics → future diagnosis)
- Treatment cohort: KELIM predicts RESISTANCE (treatment kinetics → treatment failure)

**These are complementary, not competing:**

- PLCO proves KELIM works for screening
- Treatment cohort proves KELIM works for resistance monitoring

**Action Needed:** Confirm this is correct - are we validating two different use cases?

## 🔴 QUESTION 5: SUCCESS PROBABILITY ASSESSMENT

### The Problem:

- **Task lists sources** but doesn't assess likelihood of success
- **Project Data Sphere:** What's the approval rate?
- **KELIM developers:** Will they respond? What's their collaboration history?
- **How do we rank by probability, not just timeline?**


### The Hard Question:

**How do we assess and rank sources by SUCCESS PROBABILITY, not just timeline?**

**Factors:**

- Public platforms: Higher success rate, but longer timeline
- Academic collaborators: Lower success rate, but faster if they respond
- Trial consortia: Lowest success rate, longest timeline


### My Answer (Attempt):

**Ranking Framework:**

1. **Success Probability** (0-1):
    - Public platforms: 0.8 (high approval rate, but slow)
    - Academic collaborators: 0.3-0.5 (depends on relationship)
    - Trial consortia: 0.1-0.2 (lowest, but highest quality)
2. **Timeline** (weeks):
    - Public platforms: 4-8 weeks
    - Academic collaborators: 2-6 weeks (if they respond)
    - Trial consortia: 8-12 weeks
3. **Data Quality** (0-1):
    - Public platforms: 0.9 (standardized, complete)
    - Academic collaborators: 0.7-0.9 (varies)
    - Trial consortia: 0.95 (highest quality)

**Combined Score:** `success_probability × data_quality / timeline`

**Action Needed:** Create probability assessment for each source - how?
