# Decision Record: Primary Reference Genome Build

This document records the analysis and final decision regarding the primary human genome reference build for Project Ascension.

## 1. Analysis of Key Data Sources

The choice between `hg19/GRCh37` and `hg38/GRCh38` was evaluated based on compatibility with our most likely sources of RUNX1-FPD and related cancer genomics data.

*   **LOVD3 Platform (Global Variome shared LOVD):** This critical resource for RUNX1 variant data is primarily configured to use **`hg19/GRCh37`**. While some `hg38` mappings exist, full API support is not yet implemented, and `hg19` ensures maximum compatibility with the existing dataset.

*   **TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas):** TCGA data presents a mixed environment.
    *   **Version 31.0:** Uses GENCODE 22, aligned to **`hg19/GRCh37`**.
    *   **Version 32.0:** Uses GENCODE 36, aligned to `hg38/GRCh38`.
    *   While `hg38` is more recent, using `hg19` ensures compatibility with a significant portion of available TCGA data without requiring complex mapping operations.

*   **General Genomic Tools & Vendor Data:** Many established bioinformatics tools, exome enrichment kits, and vendor reports still standardize on **`hg19/GRCh37`** or its derivatives (e.g., b37+decoy).

## 2. Recommendation and Final Decision

Based on the analysis, a definitive decision has been made.

**Primary Build:** **`hg19/GRCh37`**

**Rationale:**

1.  **Maximal Compatibility:** Adopting `hg19` provides the most straightforward compatibility with the LOVD3 platform, a primary source for our specific target.
2.  **Reduced Complexity:** It avoids the need for on-the-fly conversion or mapping of `hg38` data, reducing the risk of errors and ensuring consistency.
3.  **Broad Tool Support:** It aligns with a wide array of existing and legacy datasets and bioinformatics tools that are still prevalent in the research community.

All subsequent sequence extractions and analyses in Project Ascension will consistently use the `hg19/GRCh37` build to ensure data integrity and prevent mapping errors.
