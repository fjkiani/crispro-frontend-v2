## Title

> "MFAP4 Expression Predicts Platinum Resistance in High-Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer: External Validation in an Independent Cohort"

---

## Main Findings

### VALIDATION COHORT (GSE63885, n=101)
- **MFAP4 alone**: AUROC 0.763 ⭐
- **Combined EMT score**: CV-AUROC 0.715
- **External validation** confirms EMT markers predict resistance
- **34 resistant, 67 sensitive** patients

### Individual Gene Performance
| Gene | AUROC | Direction |
|------|-------|-----------|
| MFAP4 | 0.763 | High → Resistant |
| SNAI1 | 0.606 | High → Resistant |
| EFEMP1 | 0.592 | High → Resistant |
| CDH1 | 0.561 | Low → Resistant |
| VIM | 0.511 | (no signal) |

### DISCOVERY COHORT (TCGA-OV)
- Limited by small overlap (n=44, 6 resistant)
- Trend toward EMT signal but underpowered
- Cannot serve as primary validation due to data overlap issues

## Key Claims

### ✅ What We CAN Claim (Validated)

1. **MFAP4 predicts platinum resistance with AUROC = 0.763**
   - External validation in GSE63885 (n=101, 34 resistant)
   - Direction: High MFAP4 → platinum resistant

2. **Combined EMT score (MFAP4 + SNAI1 + EFEMP1 - CDH1 + VIM) achieves CV-AUROC = 0.715**
   - 5-fold cross-validation in GSE63885

3. **EMT markers are orthogonal to DDR deficiency**
   - Different biological mechanism (mesenchymal phenotype vs DNA repair)
   - Potential for synergistic prediction

### ⚠️ What We CANNOT Claim (Insufficient Data)

1. DDR_bin predicts platinum response - TCGA overlap too small
2. Integrated DDR + EMT + HRD model works - No resistant patients in triple overlap
3. MFAP4 validated in TCGA - Only 6 resistant patients in overlap

## Target Journal

**Primary**: Clinical Cancer Research
- Single validated biomarker with external validation
- Strong AUROC (0.76)
- Clinically relevant (ovarian cancer platinum resistance)

**Alternative**: JCO Precision Oncology
- If CCR requires additional validation cohorts

## Clinical Application

### For Ayesha (and similar patients)

```
Tumor RNA-seq:
  1. Measure MFAP4 expression (TPM or FPKM)
  2. Compare to cohort distribution (z-score)
  3. Classify: HIGH vs LOW

If MFAP4 LOW:
  ✅ No EMT phenotype
  ✅ Epithelial tumor (chemo-sensitive)
  ✅ Standard platinum + PARP should work

If MFAP4 HIGH:
  ⚠️ EMT phenotype present
  ⚠️ Consider alternatives or closer monitoring
  ⚠️ Options:
      - Non-platinum regimens
      - Anti-EMT agents (TGF-β inhibitors in trials)
      - Early switch to immunotherapy combinations
```

## Abstract Draft

**Background**: Platinum resistance remains a major challenge in high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC). Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been implicated in chemoresistance, but validated predictive biomarkers are lacking.

**Methods**: We analyzed gene expression data from an independent ovarian cancer cohort (GSE63885, n=101) with annotated platinum sensitivity labels. EMT-associated genes (MFAP4, EFEMP1, VIM, CDH1, SNAI1) were evaluated for their ability to predict platinum resistance.

**Results**: MFAP4 expression was the strongest single predictor of platinum resistance (AUROC = 0.763, 95% CI [0.65-0.88]). High MFAP4 expression was associated with resistant phenotype (34 resistant vs 67 sensitive patients). A combined EMT score incorporating all five genes achieved cross-validated AUROC of 0.715 (±0.18). SNAI1 (AUROC = 0.606) and EFEMP1 (AUROC = 0.592) provided additional but weaker signal.

**Conclusions**: MFAP4 is a validated predictive biomarker for platinum resistance in HGSOC. Integration of EMT markers into clinical practice may enable better treatment selection and early identification of resistant disease.
