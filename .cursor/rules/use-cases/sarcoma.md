Sarah, who I called Presh, was a Rally Kid who faced Ewing sarcoma, a brutal bone cancer, with incredible grace, strength, and unwavering faith. She dreamed of a career in medicine, but her greatest hope was always in the Lord.
 
Sarah passed away in 2016 at just 19 years old. 
 
It was both beautiful and heartbreaking to walk alongside her and her family as the relapses kept coming. Her legacy lives on in so many ways, including the Monarch Butterfly Award we present each year at Rally On the Runway.
 
Sarah painted a monarch butterfly, seeing its transformation as symbolic of the journey kids with cancer go through: from diagnosis to treatment, from suffering to hope.

She was right. It is a long, hard, and often uncertain journey. That award, which is a copy of her painting, is given to someone who truly is committed to that journey by helping Rally fulfill our mission.
