SECTION I: OPENING (Draft 2 - Reframed)
Cancer isn't a static genome—it's a population under selection. I can predict which genes drive metastasis and which drugs match a patient's variants at diagnosis. What I cannot predict is how tumor subclones evolve resistance, which escape routes they'll take under therapeutic pressure, or when to switch therapies as clonal fitness landscapes shift. That's an evolutionary biology problem, not an engineering problem.

By December 2025, I'd submitted two computational oncology abstracts to AACR that prove I can build, validate, and communicate AI systems grounded in biology. The first manuscript—"Metastasis Interception Through Stage-Specific CRISPR Guide Design"—achieved 100% structural validation across 15 guide:DNA complexes using AlphaFold 3, establishing the first empirically validated acceptance criteria for functional guide design (pLDDT ≥50, iPTM ≥0.30). The system achieved AUROC 0.976 for target gene prioritization across eight metastatic steps. The second manuscript—"Multi-Modal Drug Efficacy Prediction in Multiple Myeloma"—demonstrated 100% pathway alignment across five MAPK variants, using ablation studies to prove pathway context is necessary for accurate drug-gene matching. Both systems work at a single timepoint: diagnosis.

But here's what these systems can't do: When I validated the CRISPR paper against published cell line data, BRAF knockdown in melanoma selected for NRAS-driven escape within eight weeks. My system correctly prioritized BRAF as essential for metastasis—but it couldn't predict the NRAS rescue pathway. That's clonal selection, not gene essentiality. Similarly, the drug efficacy paper matches PARP inhibitors to DDR-deficient patients at diagnosis—but it can't forecast which resistant subclones will emerge six months into treatment. I've seen this limitation play out in real patient data: I validated resistance markers in 995 multiple myeloma patients where DIS3 mutations predicted 2.08× mortality risk (p=0.0145), and in 469 ovarian cancer patients where MAPK mutations predicted 1.97× platinum resistance (p<0.05). But those are static risk flags at diagnosis. They don't model the temporal dynamics of how clonal populations shift under drug selection.

I'm applying to Richard Gilder Graduate School because I need phylogenetic methods for clonal lineage tracing from longitudinal sequencing data, selection analysis frameworks to quantify fitness coefficients for resistant clones, and the Museum's comparative genomics infrastructure to identify conserved escape mechanisms across cancer types. I need to stop treating tumors as snapshots and start modeling them as evolving populations.
