## 🎯 WHY THIS TRIAL IS A GOOD FIT FOR AYESHA (LLM Analysis)

### **Clinical Trial Analysis: NCT05572684**

**Note**: This is a structured fallback analysis (LLM unavailable).

#### **1. Drug Mechanism Fit**
The trial "A Safety, Tolerability and Efficacy Study of NC410 Plus Pembrolizumab in Participants with Advanced Unresectable or Metastatic Solid Tumors" requires detailed mechanism analysis. Review the trial protocol to understand how the investigational drug addresses Ayesha's Stage IVB High-Grade Serous Ovarian Carcinoma with extensive tumor burden and pleural metastases.

#### **2. Location Logistics**
Review trial locations to identify NYC metro sites accessible from ZIP 10029 (East Harlem). Preferred centers: Mount Sinai (local), MSK (2 miles), NYU Langone (3-4 miles).

#### **3. Risk-Benefit for Ayesha**
**Key Considerations**:
- Pulmonary compromise: Large bilateral pleural effusions require careful monitoring
- ECOG 1: Acceptable for most trials, but toxicity profile is critical
- Tumor burden: Extensive disease (CA-125 >2800) may require aggressive initial treatment

#### **4. Comparison to Standard of Care**
Ayesha's planned SOC is Carboplatin + Paclitaxel + Bevacizumab (NCCN-guideline first-line therapy for Stage IVB HGSOC, BRCA wildtype). This trial should be compared to this regimen to assess:
- Is it a replacement for SOC (frontline trial)?
- Is it additional to SOC (maintenance trial)?
- Is it an alternative if SOC fails?

#### **5. Critical Considerations**
1. **Biomarker testing**: HER2 and HRD status are unknown - may be required for enrollment
2. **Timing**: When should Ayesha enroll? Before SOC, during SOC, or after response?
3. **Clinical team review**: Discuss with Ayesha's oncologist before enrollment decisions

**Recommendation**: Full protocol review with clinical team required.

### Eligibility Criteria
Inclusion Criteria:

* Be 18 years of age on day of signing informed consent.
* Participant with histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of the following advanced unresectable and/or metastatic solid tumors:

  * Phase 1b: Participants with solid tumors that are known to be associated as MSS/MSI-low in the majority including: CRC (without liver metastasis), Gastric including GE junction, Esophageal, Ovarian, and H\&N cancer (regardless of prior treatment with ICIs). Note: Participants must have had disease progression after at least one line of systemic standard of care therapy prior to enrollment. Participants who discontinue standard treatment due to intolerance or refuse standard treatment will also be eligible to enroll.
  * Phase 2 ICI Refractory Solid Tumors (Cohort 1): Participants with solid tumors including CRC, Gastric including GE junction, Esophageal, Endometrial, H\&N, Lung, Cervical and Ovarian cancer.Participants must have progressed on treatment with an anti-PD1/L1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) administered either as monotherapy, or in combination with other checkpoint inhibitors or other therapies. PD-1 treatment progression is defined by meeting all of the following criteria:

    * Has received at least 2 doses of an approved anti-PD-1/L1 mAb.
    * Has demonstrated disease progression after PD-1/L1 as defined by RECIST v1.1.
  * Phase 2 ICI naïve Solid Tumors (Cohorts 2a-2c):Tumors known to be associated with MSS/MSI-low status such as CRC, Gastric including GE junction, and Ovarian cancer where participants have not been previously treated with ICIs. Note: Participants must have had disease progression after at least one line of systemic standard of care therapy prior to enrollment. Participants who discontinue standard treatment due to intolerance or refuse standard treatment will also be eligible to enroll. Note: Confirmation of MSS/MSI status should be assessed prior to study entry (either by historical result or during screening).
* A male participant must agree to use contraception and refrain from sperm donation or expecting to father a child, from Screening through the treatment period and for at least 120 days after the last dose of study treatment.

  * Not a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP)
  * A WOCBP who agrees to follow contraceptive guidance outlined in the protocol from Screening through the treatment period and for at least 120 days after the last dose of study treatment.
* Have measurable disease per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by the local site investigator/radiology. Lesions situated in a previously irradiated area are considered measurable if progression has been demonstrated in such lesions.
* Able to provide tumor tissue sample at Screening, archival (≤ 5 years old) or newly obtained core or excisional biopsy of a tumor lesion not previously irradiated. Formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks are preferred to slides. Newly obtained biopsies are preferred to archived tissue.
* Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 1.
* Life expectancy greater than or equal to 12 weeks as judged by the Investigator.
* Have adequate organ function as defined in the protocol.

Exclusion Criteria:

* A WOCBP who has a positive urine pregnancy test (within 72 hours) prior to treatment. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required.
* Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti PD L2 agent or with an agent directed to another stimulatory or co-inhibitory T-cell receptor (e.g., CTLA-4, OX40, CD137), and was discontinued from that treatment due to a Grade 3 or higher irAE.
* Has received prior systemic anti-cancer therapy including investigational agents within 4 weeks (could consider shorter interval for kinase inhibitors or other short half-life drugs) prior to treatment. Note: Participants must have recovered from all AEs due to previous therapies to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline. Participants with ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy may be eligible.
