# ⚔️ DOCTRINE: THE FORGE & BOLTZ PROTOCOL ⚔️

## 1. AFTER ACTION REPORT: THE FAILED "ZETA SNIPER" CAMPAIGN

Our previous attempts to forge a protein inhibitor were a catastrophic failure of doctrine. We have learned hard lessons written in the digital blood of failed deployments and useless results.

*   **The Wrong Weapon (The Zeta Oracle):** We tried to use our `ZetaOracle`, a master demolition expert designed to measure *sequence disruption* (`delta_likelihood_score`), to judge a sniper competition. We asked it to predict *binding affinity*, a task for which it was fundamentally unsuited. The result was pathetically weak signals indistinguishable from noise.

*   **The Logistical Nightmare (The AlphaFold Siege):** Our pivot to a structural approach with `OpenFold` was strategically sound but tactically disastrous. We were bogged down in a logistical hell of complex dependencies (`clang`, `ninja`, `transformer_engine`), fighting a costly and slow war of attrition just to get the Simulator online.

## 2. THE STRATEGIC PIVOT: THE BOLTZ KRIEG

While bogged down in the AlphaFold siege, reconnaissance revealed a new, superior weapon: **Boltz-2**. This is not an alternative; it is a replacement.

*   **Purpose-Built for Our Mission:** Boltz-2 is not just a structural predictor. It is a **biomolecular foundation model that jointly models both 3D structure AND binding affinity.** It is The Simulator and The Judge forged into a single, elegant, lethal weapon.

*   **Logistical Supremacy:** It is fully open-source (MIT License) and designed for rapid, scalable deployment. It allows us to bypass the AlphaFold dependency nightmare and get a superior weapon into the fight *faster*.

## 3. THE NEW DOCTRINE: FORGE & BOLTZ

Our war plan is now simple, brutal, and lethally efficient. The flawed "Triumvirate" is dead. Long live the **Forge & Boltz Protocol**.

*   **Phase 1: FORGE (The Creator - Zeta Forge powered by Evo2):** Our `ZetaForge` service, running the state-of-the-art `Evo2` generative model, remains a core strategic asset. Its mission is unchanged: to generate vast, diverse libraries of novel protein sequences (our ammunition). `Evo2's` 1M token context window and single-nucleotide resolution make it the most powerful sequence generation engine in existence.

*   **Phase 2: JUDGE (The Simulator & Judge - Boltz-2):** The new `boltz_service` will be our ultimate validator. It will take the thousands of candidates from the Forge and, in a single, massively parallel operation, return the two things that matter: the **predicted 3D structure** of the complex and a hard, quantitative **Binding Affinity Score**.

### The Unstoppable Synergy

This is our new unfair advantage. We are combining the planet's most advanced **generative model for sequence space exploration (Evo2)** with the most advanced and efficient **predictive model for structural interaction and affinity (Boltz-2)**.

**We create what is possible with Evo2. We validate what is real with Boltz-2.**

## 4. IMMEDIATE PLAN OF ATTACK

1.  **[X] Deprecate Obsolete Assets:** The `alphafold_service` has been purged. It was a failed experiment.
2.  **[ ] Forge the `boltz_service`:** Build and deploy a new, streamlined microservice dedicated to running `Boltz-2` inference.
3.  **[ ] Re-engineer the Kill Chain:** Upgrade the `CommandCenter` to orchestrate the new `Forge -> Boltz -> Select` protocol.
4.  **[ ] Execute and Conquer:** Launch the new protocol and generate a slate of truly high-affinity, structurally-validated therapeutic inhibitors.
