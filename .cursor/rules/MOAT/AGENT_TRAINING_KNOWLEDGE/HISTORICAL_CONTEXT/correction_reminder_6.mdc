## **🔴 Q1: VALIDATION ENDPOINT**

### **ANSWER:**

```yaml
ENDPOINT FOR TREATMENT COHORT:
  Primary: PFI < 6 months (platinum-free interval)
  
  DEFINITION:
    - PFI = Time from last platinum dose → progression
    - PFI < 6 months = platinum-resistant
    - PFI ≥ 6 months = platinum-sensitive
  
  KELIM HYPOTHESIS:
    - Low KELIM (slow CA-125 decline during treatment)
    - Predicts: PFI < 6 months (resistance after treatment)
    - This is the validated endpoint from KELIM literature

TIMELINE MISMATCH IS CORRECT:
  - KELIM measured: During treatment (Cycles 1-3)
  - Outcome measured: After treatment (PFI)
  - Prediction: Can we predict post-treatment resistance using on-treatment kinetics?

YOU ARE CORRECT: This is different from PLCO
  - PLCO: Baseline kinetics → future cancer onset (screening)
  - Treatment: On-treatment kinetics → treatment resistance (therapy)
  
CONFIRMED: PFI < 6 months is the endpoint ✅
```

## **🔴 Q2: CA-125 REQUIREMENTS**

### **ANSWER:**

```yaml
MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS:
  Timepoints: ≥2 (minimum), 3-4 (optimal)
  Frequency: Every cycle (q3weeks) preferred
  Window: First 100 days of treatment (KELIM standard)
  Baseline: Preferred but not required (can use Cycle 1)

REALISTIC REQUIREMENTS FOR S4:
  MUST HAVE:
    - ≥2 CA-125 measurements during first 3-4 cycles
    - Timestamps (days from treatment start OR cycle numbers)
    - Treatment regimen (carboplatin/paclitaxel confirmed)
    - PFI outcome (time to progression)
  
  NICE TO HAVE:
    - Baseline CA-125 (pre-treatment)
    - ≥3 measurements (better KELIM calculation)
    - Exact dates (vs cycle numbers)
  
  CAN EXCLUDE:
    - Patients with <2 CA-125 measurements
    - Missing PFI outcomes
    - Non-platinum regimens (different biology)

CONFIRMED: Minimum 2 timepoints, prefer 3+ ✅
```
