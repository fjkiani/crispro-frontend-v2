## Will It Work For Me? A simple, honest answer – with confidence

Cancer decisions are hard because the data is messy. We built a new kind of in‑silico copilot that turns raw genetics into a ranked, plain‑English answer: which medicines look most promising for this biology, and how confident are we?

### How it works (in human terms)
- Read your genetics: We look at the exact variants (e.g., a BRAF mutation) and ask: does this change the protein? the pathway it sits in? the cell’s behavior?
- Map to medicines: We line up drugs by how they work (their mechanism) and ask if that matches what’s broken in the cell.
- Check the evidence: Standard‑of‑care badges, guidelines, and cohort context improve confidence. Everything we do is transparent and explained in the output.

### What you get (the output)
- A ranked list of medicines with two numbers: efficacy (fit) and confidence.
- Labels you recognize: “Supported” (on‑label/guideline), “Consider” (off‑label but reasonable), or “Insufficient.”
- Four simple insight chips: Function, Regulatory, Essentiality, Chromatin – what changed and why it matters.
- Receipts: every lift in confidence comes with provenance (run ID, profile, data sources). No black boxes.

### Why this is different
- Designed for honesty: Confidence lifts are bounded, toggleable, and justified. If the evidence is thin, we show it.
- Built for action: Results are structured JSON that FE/BE can render or export instantly.
- Research‑use only (RUO): Not clinical advice. It’s a faster, clearer way to prioritize the next experiment or therapy discussion.

### Multiple Myeloma example
- Standard‑of‑care therapies (proteasome inhibitors, IMiDs, Anti‑CD38) are clearly labeled and prioritized.
- If variants disrupt RAS/MAPK, MAPK‑aligned drugs move up the list with “PathwayAligned” evidence.
- Cohorts and calibration add small, transparent boosts to confidence – never hype.

### Why it matters for oncology
- Less guesswork, faster cycles: turn “unknowns” into ranked, auditable options.
- Budget smarter: focus on hypotheses that make biological and pathway sense.
- Built‑in provenance: you can trace every score back to its source.
