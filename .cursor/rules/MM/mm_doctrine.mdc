# Multiple Myeloma – End‑to‑End Doctrine (RUO)

## Purpose (why this exists vs slides)
- This doctrine is the single source of truth for MM: what we deliver live, how to read it, which endpoints produce it, and how to talk about it without overclaiming.
- The slide deck is copy‑ready and concise. This doctrine contains the details: JSON anchors, curl examples, semantics, and RUO posture.

## What we solved (plain language)
We convert noisy MM variants into a transparent therapy game plan you can read and defend: ranked drug classes (score + confidence + tier + badges), a pathway story (why), a toxicity hint (plan safely), trials context (shortlist counts), and provenance (run_id) so everything is auditable.

## Live outputs (snapshot)
- Efficacy (subset, BRAF V600E, baseline profile with lifts ON; Fusion eligible):
  - Proteasome inhibitor: efficacy_score 0.53, confidence 0.89, tier supported, badges [FDA‑OnLabel, PathwayAligned]
  - BRAF/MEK inhibitors: efficacy_score 0.75, confidence 0.79, tier consider, badges [PathwayAligned]
- Toxicity hint (germline): helper “plan cautiously under DNA‑damaging exposure”, confidence 0.55, source ClinVar link (RUO)
- Trials summary: “50+ → 7” with categories {likely:3, potential:4, unlikely:0}
- Fusion coverage: true (GRCh38 missense gate)
- ClinVar prior: classification pathogenic; URL returned
- Provenance: run_id present (cite on slides); sequence_scoring.mode = fusion_am_local

## Endpoints (what produces those outputs)
- Efficacy: `POST /api/efficacy/predict` → { drugs[*].{ name, efficacy_score, confidence, evidence_tier, badges, insights, rationale }, cohort_signals, provenance, run_signature }
- Insights (chips):
  - Functionality: `POST /api/insights/predict_protein_functionality_change`
  - Essentiality: `POST /api/insights/predict_gene_essentiality`
  - Regulatory/splicing: `POST /api/insights/predict_splicing_regulatory`
  - Chromatin: `POST /api/insights/predict_chromatin_accessibility`
- Fusion coverage: `GET /api/fusion/coverage?chrom&pos&ref&alt`
- ClinVar prior (minimal): `GET /api/evidence/clinvar?chrom&pos&ref&alt[&gene&hgvs_p]`
- Toxicity hint: `POST /api/toxicity/hint`

## How to read the JSON (anchors you can safely cite)
- Per‑drug: `drugs[*].{ efficacy_score, confidence, evidence_tier, badges, rationale }`
- Chips: `drugs[*].insights.{ functionality, chromatin, essentiality, regulatory }`
- Cohorts: `cohort_signals.{ coverage_by_gene, response_rates, provenance }`
- Trials: `provenance.trials.{ shortlist_compression, categories }`
- Fusion: `fusion_coverage.coverage` (true when GRCh38 missense)
- ClinVar: `clinvar.{ classification, url }`
- Provenance: `provenance.{ run_id, profile, sequence_scoring.mode }`

## Capabilities inventory (live today)
- Efficacy (S/P/E): Composite signal with evidence gates and modest, bounded lifts; PathwayAligned badge and rationale explain “why.”
- Insights bundle: four chips (Functionality/Chromatin/Essentiality/Regulatory) to translate biology quickly.
- Toxicity hint (germline): small, conservative caution with helper, confidence, and sources (RUO).
- Cohort overlays: stubbed container returned now; ready to wire to datasets for lifts with provenance.
- Trials: shortlist compression and counts included in provenance.
- Provenance: run_id + profile for auditability; cite on slides and docs.

## Semantic alignment (only live‑backed items)
- “Target engagement” → S/P fit: Functionality + PathwayAligned + sequence disruption (partial proxy)
- “Pathway modulation” → Pathway percentile + PathwayAligned (live)
- “Cytotoxicity” → Toxicity Risk chip (live, RUO)
- “Patient stratification” → Ranked therapies + confidence + cohort_signals (partial)
- “IND package” → Dossier export with provenance (partial; RUO)

Avoid road‑map claims (PK/PD, multi‑organ toxicity, ORR/PFS/OS, affinity/selectivity) in public assets.

## RUO posture and limits
- This is research‑use only. Confidence varies with inputs and eligibility (e.g., Fusion coverage). Literature may be sparse; lifts remain modest. Cohorts are stubbed unless connected. Always cite `provenance.run_id`.

## Copy‑ready anchors (website/slides)
- “Ranked therapies with score, confidence, evidence tier, and badges — each with provenance (run_id).”
- “Four simple chips turn variants into readable biology: Function, Regulatory, Essentiality, Chromatin.”
- “A small germline‑aware toxicity hint helps teams plan conservatively (RUO).”
- “Trials context summarized (50+ → N) with Likely/Potential/Unlikely counts; one‑pager export ready.”

## Curl (local dev example)
```bash
curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/efficacy/predict \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "mutations":[{"gene":"BRAF","hgvs_p":"V600E","chrom":"7","pos":140453136,"ref":"T","alt":"A"}],
    "disease":"multiple myeloma",
    "model_id":"evo2_1b",
    "options":{"adaptive":true,"ensemble":true,"include_fda_badges":true,"include_cohort_overlays":true,"include_calibration_snapshot":true}
  }'
```

## Relationship to the slide deck
- The slide deck uses the live outputs and copy anchors from this doctrine. Keep the deck concise (no engineering details), always cite a run_id, and avoid roadmap claims.
