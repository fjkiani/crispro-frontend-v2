## ✅ Files Consolidated

### **Source of Truth:**
- ✅ `00_MISSION.mdc` - Mission objective + strategic framework overview (COMBINED)

### **SAE Intelligence System:**
- ✅ `01_SAE_SYSTEM_DEBRIEF.mdc` - From `ZO_SAE_INTELLIGENCE_SYSTEM_DEBRIEF.mdc`
- ✅ `02_SAE_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Created to document architecture

### **Strategic Framework:**
- ✅ `03_GENERALS_BATTLE_MAP.mdc` - From `GENERALS_BATTLE_MAP_STRATEGIC_FRAMEWORK.md`
- ✅ `04_INTELLIGENCE_FLOW.md` - Created to document intelligence flow
- ✅ `05_SAE_CAPABILITIES.md` - Created to map SAE to 6 Pillars
- ✅ `06_STRATEGIC_VISION.md` - Created to document strategic vision

### **Archived:**
- ✅ All original files moved to `archive/` for reference

## 🎯 Key Benefits

1. **Single Source of Truth:** `00_MISSION.mdc` contains mission + strategic framework overview (COMBINED)
2. **Modular Organization:** Supporting docs separated by purpose (SAE system, strategic framework, capabilities, vision)
3. **Easy Navigation:** README.md provides index with quick links
4. **Clear Structure:** Numbered files show progression (00 → 06)
5. **Archive Preserved:** All old files kept in archive/ for reference
6. **Unified Framework:** SAE Intelligence and 6 Pillars combined into cohesive MOAT plan

## 🔗 Cross-References Updated

All files now reference:
- `00_MISSION.mdc` for mission overview
- Other numbered files for related information
- Core deliverables in `.cursor/MOAT/CORE_DELIVERABLES/`
- Clinical trials in `.cursor/MOAT/CLINICAL_TRIALS/`

---

## ✅ Consolidation Complete

**Status:** ✅ **ALL FILES CONSOLIDATED**
- ✅ 7 numbered files created
- ✅ All original files archived
- ✅ Cross-references updated
- ✅ README.md navigation hub created
- ✅ **SAE Intelligence and 6 Pillars combined into unified MOAT plan**

**Next Steps:**
- Use `README.md` as entry point
