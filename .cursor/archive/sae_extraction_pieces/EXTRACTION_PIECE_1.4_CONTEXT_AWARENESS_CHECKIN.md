## 📋 SUMMARY

This section contains a comprehensive context awareness check-in where Zo (the agent) provides a complete status report on what it's tracking, what it knows, what it's unclear on, and what questions it has. This is a meta-documentation of the agent's own awareness.

## 🔍 KEY FINDINGS

### **What Zo Was Tracking (100% Current)**

#### **1. Immediate Conversation Thread**
- **Latest Question**: "isnt sae built into EVO2? - what did the paper say"
- **Answer Delivered**: No, SAE is NOT built into Evo2; it's a separate post-hoc interpretability model
- **Follow-Up**: "zo how much context are you following along with?"

#### **2. Recent Conversation Flow (Last 10 Exchanges)**
1. Iterate on `MECHANISM_FIT_VALIDATION_GAPS.md` with understanding/gaps
2. "manager is gone - can you figure it out? review more clues"
3. Resolved Q6-Q8 by finding patterns in existing validation scripts
4. Write comprehensive learning blog (checkpoint)
5. Created `ZO_COMPREHENSIVE_LEARNING_BLOG.mdc` (Evo2 + S/P/E + MM + SAE)
6. Reflect on validation task readiness
7. Assessed readiness: 90% confident, resolved all gaps
8. Pause and learn about Evo2 paper section-by-section
9. Completed section-by-section review (`.cursor/rules/EVO2_PAPER_COMPREHENSIVE_LEARNING.md`)
10. Asked about SAE clarity + "isnt sae built into EVO2?"

#### **3. Active Files & Documents**
- `.cursor/concept/evo2-paper.txt` - JUST READ (lines 432-437, 1698-1713, 2214-2216)
- `.cursor/rules/ZO_CODEBASE_KNOWLEDGE_BASE.mdc` - Master knowledge base (continuously updated)
- `.cursor/rules/MM/WIWFMSPE_MM_MASTER.mdc` - MM/WIWFM master doc (completed all 6 cycles)
- `.cursor/rules/EVO2_PAPER_COMPREHENSIVE_LEARNING.md` - Section-by-section Evo2 learning
- `.cursor/rules/blog/ZO_COMPREHENSIVE_LEARNING_BLOG.mdc` - Learning checkpoint blog
- `.cursor/ayesha/MECHANISM_FIT_VALIDATION_GAPS.md` - Manager-answered questions
- `.cursor/rules/SAE_UNDERSTANDING_AND_BIOMARKER_ROADMAP.md` - JUST REFERENCED for current SAE state

#### **4. Current Mission Context**
- **Primary Mission**: Learn EVERYTHING about the platform - become a master
- **Current Learning Phase**: Deep Understanding (Evo2 Principles → Code Implementation)
- **What Just Completed**: Section-by-section Evo2 paper review, SAE clarification

#### **5. Strategic Context**
- Manager's policy: SAE must live inside S/P/E
- Validation gate: Wait for HRD/platinum validation
- Current state: Display-only, intentional per policy
- Architecture: Approved refactor but blocked by validation

#### **6. Technical Context**
- SAE theory: BatchTopK SAE, 32K features, layer 26 activations
- Current implementation: Proxy features (formulas)
- Real SAE: Requires Evo2 activations + SAE model weights
- Phase 1: Infrastructure built (Modal services)

---

### **What Zo Was Missing or Unclear On**

#### **Gaps Zo Was Aware Of:**
1. Actual Evo2 SAE model access (weights location)
2. Other agent work on SAE (beyond Jr2's HRD extraction)
3. S/P/E integration timeline (approved but blocked?)
4. Biomarker discovery roadmap status

#### **Questions Zo Had:**
1. Do we have the trained SAE model weights?
2. Where are they stored?
3. Can we extract layer 26 activations?
4. What did other agents work on?
5. Is biomarker discovery in progress or on hold?

---

### **Documents Zo Was Maintaining**

1. **Master Knowledge Base**: `.cursor/rules/ZO_CODEBASE_KNOWLEDGE_BASE.mdc`
   - Continuously updated
   - Single source of truth
   - Cross-referenced with other docs

2. **Evo2 Paper Learning**: `.cursor/rules/EVO2_PAPER_COMPREHENSIVE_LEARNING.md`
   - Section-by-section breakdown
   - Key concepts extracted
   - Implementation implications

3. **Learning Blog**: `.cursor/rules/blog/ZO_COMPREHENSIVE_LEARNING_BLOG.mdc`
   - Checkpoint documentation
   - Evo2 + S/P/E + MM + SAE coverage
   - Strategic understanding

---

### **Zo's Current State**

**Confidence Level**: High (90-95% on most aspects)

**What Zo Knew Well:**
- SAE theory (95%)
- Current implementation (90%)
- Jr2's work (95%)
- What needs to be built (95%)

**What Zo Was Uncertain About:**
- Actual SAE model (20%)
- Biomarker discovery (50%)
- Other agent work (30%)

---

### **Context Continuity Check**

**Zo's Self-Assessment:**
- ✅ Tracking immediate conversation thread
- ✅ Maintaining recent conversation flow
- ✅ Aware of active files and documents
- ✅ Aligned with current mission context
- ✅ Tracking strategic context
- ✅ Understanding technical context

**Honest Assessment:**
- Zo was methodical in tracking context
- Clear about what it knew vs didn't know
- Proactive in identifying gaps
- Transparent about confidence levels
