## 🎯 WHY THIS TRIAL IS A GOOD FIT FOR AYESHA (LLM Analysis)

### **Clinical Trial Analysis: NCT04729387**

**Note**: This is a structured fallback analysis (LLM unavailable).

#### **1. Drug Mechanism Fit**
The trial "Alpelisib Plus Olaparib in Platinum-resistant/Refractory, High-grade Serous Ovarian Cancer, With no Germline BRCA Mutation Detected" requires detailed mechanism analysis. Review the trial protocol to understand how the investigational drug addresses Ayesha's Stage IVB High-Grade Serous Ovarian Carcinoma with extensive tumor burden and pleural metastases.

#### **2. Location Logistics**
Review trial locations to identify NYC metro sites accessible from ZIP 10029 (East Harlem). Preferred centers: Mount Sinai (local), MSK (2 miles), NYU Langone (3-4 miles).

#### **3. Risk-Benefit for Ayesha**
**Key Considerations**:
- Pulmonary compromise: Large bilateral pleural effusions require careful monitoring
- ECOG 1: Acceptable for most trials, but toxicity profile is critical
- Tumor burden: Extensive disease (CA-125 >2800) may require aggressive initial treatment

#### **4. Comparison to Standard of Care**
Ayesha's planned SOC is Carboplatin + Paclitaxel + Bevacizumab (NCCN-guideline first-line therapy for Stage IVB HGSOC, BRCA wildtype). This trial should be compared to this regimen to assess:
- Is it a replacement for SOC (frontline trial)?
- Is it additional to SOC (maintenance trial)?
- Is it an alternative if SOC fails?

#### **5. Critical Considerations**
1. **Biomarker testing**: HER2 and HRD status are unknown - may be required for enrollment
2. **Timing**: When should Ayesha enroll? Before SOC, during SOC, or after response?
3. **Clinical team review**: Discuss with Ayesha's oncologist before enrollment decisions

**Recommendation**: Full protocol review with clinical team required.

## 📋 FULL ELIGIBILITY TEXT

### Eligibility Criteria
Inclusion Criteria:

* Participant has histologically confirmed diagnosis of high-grade serous or high-grade endometrioid ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer
* Measurable disease, i.e., at least one measurable lesion per RECIST 1.1 criteria (a lesion at a previously irradiated site may only be counted as a target lesion if there is clear sign of progression since the irradiation)
* If no measurable disease is present, the disease should be assessable by Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup criteria (GCIC) for CA-125
* Participant has no germline BRCA1/2 mutation as determined by an FDA approved assay.
* Participant has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1
* Participant has platinum-resistant (progression within one to six months after completing platinum-based therapy) or platinum refractory disease (progression during treatment or within 4 weeks after the last dose), where platinum-based therapy is not an option, according to the GCIG 5th Ovarian Cancer Consensus Conference definitions. The platinum-based chemotherapy regimen does not necessarily need to be the last regimen the participant received prior to study entry.
* Participant must have received at least one but no more than three prior systemic treatment regimens and for whom single-agent chemotherapy is appropriate as the next line of treatment.
* Participant has adequate bone marrow and organ function

Exclusion Criteria:

* Participant has received prior treatment with any PI3K, mTOR or AKT inhibitor.
* Participant is concurrently using other anti-cancer therapy
* Participant is in a state of small or large bowel obstruction or has other impairment of gastrointestinal (GI) function or GI disease
* Participant has had surgery within 14 days prior to starting study drug or has not recovered from major side effects
* Participant has not recovered from all toxicities 5 related to prior anticancer therapies to baseline or NCI CTCAE Version 4.03 Grade ≤1. Exception to this criterion: participants with any grade of alopecia are allowed to enter the study.
* Participants with liver impairment and Child Pugh score B or C
* Participant has received radiotherapy ≤ 4 weeks or limited field radiation for palliation ≤2 weeks prior to randomization, and who has not recovered to baseline, grade 1 or better from related side effects of such therapy (with the exception of alopecia).
* Participant has a known hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs or excipients

Other inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply

## 📊 TRIAL DESCRIPTION

The objective of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of the combination of alpelisib and olaparib compared with single agent cytotoxic chemotherapy in patients with platinum resistant or refractory high-grade serous ovarian cancer, with no germline BRCA mutation detected.

## 🏥 LOCATION DETAILS

### NYC Metro Locations (Priority for Ayesha)

1. **Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Ctr** - New York, New York

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL GATES FOR AYESHA

✅ No critical biomarker gates identified. Proceed with standard eligibility screening.

---

## ⚔️ TACTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS

**Priority**: ⚠️ **P1 - HIGH PRIORITY** (Eligibility: ~100%)

**Next Steps**:
1. **Review eligibility carefully** (with oncologist)
2. **Order pending biomarker tests** (if required)
3. **Contact trial site** (within 1 week)
4. **Backup option** (if top-tier trials fail)


---

## 🎯 VALUE PROPOSITION

**WIN-WIN SCENARIO**:
- If eligible (100% chance) → Access to experimental therapy
- If not eligible → Gets proven SOC (PARP or bevacizumab maintenance)
- Either way, Ayesha receives appropriate care

**Risk-Benefit**: Low risk (pre-screening doesn't commit to enrollment), high reward (cutting-edge therapy)
