Scratchpad
==========

## Current task
- [x] Synthetic lethality manuscript polish: fix typos, tighten claims to receipt-backed results, and improve reproducibility pointers.

## Next (optional)
- [ ] Build a References section automatically by extracting unique PMIDs from `publications/synthetic_lethality/data/test_cases_100.json`.
- [ ] Add a 1-page cover letter draft for submission.

Lessons
=======

- When writing file quality checks, avoid substring assertions that match valid words (e.g., checking for `"nsumes"` will match inside `"consumes"`; checking for `"ass matches"` will match inside `"class matches"`). Prefer exact bad phrases.
- If editor tooling can’t read files outside the current workspace, use terminal-based scripts to update the **main repo** paths explicitly.
