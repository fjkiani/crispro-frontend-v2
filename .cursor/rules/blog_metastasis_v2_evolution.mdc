# From Good to Unstoppable: The Metastasis Interception V2 Story

**October 2025 | Research Use Only**

## The Simple Version

We built something that works. Now we're making it **impossible to ignore**.

Version 1 proved we could design CRISPR weapons against cancer's spread. Version 2 makes those weapons so precisely validated that partners can trust them with real patients.

---

## What We Built in V1 (The Foundation)

**The Core Idea:** Stop cancer from spreading by targeting the 8 steps of metastasis with custom-designed CRISPR guides.

**What We Delivered:**
- ✅ **Target-Lock Score:** AI picks which genes to hit for each metastatic step
- ✅ **Guide Design:** Generate 20-nucleotide CRISPR guides automatically
- ✅ **Efficacy Prediction:** Predict how well each guide will cut DNA
- ✅ **Safety Scoring:** Check for off-target cuts in the wrong places
- ✅ **Assassin Score:** Rank guides by overall performance (efficacy + safety + mission-fit)

**The Problem with V1:**
- Used **14 genes** (too small for confident statistics)
- **Chromatin prediction** was a placeholder (not real ML model)
- **No 3D structure validation** (sequence-only, missing critical dimension)
- Validation metrics were basic (just ROC curves, no calibration or precision-at-top)

**Translation:** V1 worked in the lab. V2 will survive Nature Biotechnology peer review.

## What Changes in V2 (The Dominance Strategy)

### 1. **Expanded Gene Set: 14 → 24 Genes**

**What We're Adding:**
- 10 new targets already in **clinical trials** (AXL, TGFβR1, CLDN4, SRC, FAK, NOTCH1, S100A4, PLOD2, CCL2, ANGPT2)
- Every addition has **trial IDs (NCT numbers)** and **published papers (PMIDs)**

**Why It Matters:**
- **71% more data points** for validation (14 → 24 genes)
- Stronger statistics → reviewers can't dismiss as "small-n study"
- Partners see targets they **already know** from ongoing trials

### 2. **Real Chromatin Prediction: Enformer ML Model**

**V1 Approach:** Placeholder heuristic ("if it's near a promoter, accessibility = high")

**V2 Approach:** 
- Deploy Google DeepMind's **Enformer** (trained on DNase-seq, CAGE, ATAC-seq data)
- Predicts chromatin accessibility from DNA sequence alone
- ±32kb context captures regulatory elements (enhancers, silencers)

**Why It Matters:**
- **No more disclaimers** like "chromatin prediction pending"
- Partners can trust the accessibility scores are real ML predictions
- Enables tissue-specific targeting (bone marrow vs liver vs brain)

### 3. **3D Structure Validation: AlphaFold3 Integration**

**The Missing Dimension in V1:**
- We knew guide sequences would bind (sequence-level scoring)
- We **didn't know** if they'd fold properly in 3D space

**V2 Solution:**
- **AlphaFold3-Multimer** predicts guide:DNA:PAM complex structure
- Measures 4 quality metrics:
  - **pLDDT ≥ 70:** Overall structure confidence
  - **Interface PAE ≤ 10Å:** Guide-to-DNA binding confidence
  - **Clashes ≤ 5:** No atoms overlapping (bad geometry)
  - **MolProbity < 2.0:** Publication-quality structure

**Why It Matters:**
- Guides that **look good in 1D can fail in 3D** (we learned this the hard way)
- +3% boost to Assassin Score for guides with perfect structure
- Partners get **PDB files** (3D structures) to inspect visually

### 4. **Enhanced Validation: 5-Metric Matrix Instead of Just ROC Curves**

**V1 Validation:**
- Basic ROC/PR curves (how well Target-Lock predicts known targets)
- One global score across all genes

**V2 Validation:**
- **Per-step ROC/PR:** Separate curves for each of 8 metastatic steps
- **Calibration curves:** Are our confidence scores actually calibrated?
- **Precision@K:** Performance on top-3, top-5, top-10 predictions (what matters clinically)
- **Ablation study:** Which signal matters most? (Functionality > Essentiality > Chromatin > Regulatory)
- **Confounder analysis:** Are we just picking long genes or high-GC regions?

**Why It Matters:**
- Reviewers can't poke holes ("what about step-specific performance?")
- Partners see **transparent trade-offs** (precision vs recall at different thresholds)
- Clinicians care about **top-3 recommendations**, not the 50th-ranked gene

### 5. **Publication-Grade Reproducibility**

**What We're Locking Down:**
- **Container digests:** Exact Docker images pinned (no version drift)
- **Random seeds:** Bootstrap seed=42, AlphaFold3 seed=42 (bit-for-bit reproducible)
- **One-command reproduction:** `./scripts/reproduce_all.sh` runs everything in <10 minutes
- **Zenodo deposit:** All 40 3D structures + code + data with permanent DOI

**Why It Matters:**
- Partners can **reproduce our results** at their site
- Regulators see **FDA-grade provenance** (audit trails for every decision)
- Science advances faster when results are reproducible

## What This Means for Partners

### **For Biotech Companies**

**V1 Value Prop:** "We can design CRISPR guides for your metastatic targets"

**V2 Value Prop:** 
- "We designed guides for **24 trial-backed targets** you already care about"
- "Every guide has a **3D structure** you can inspect"
- "We validated against clinical trial targets with **publication-grade statistics**"
- "You can **reproduce everything** at your site in 10 minutes"

**Translation:** V1 was a demo. V2 is a product you can bet your pipeline on.

### **For Academic Partners**

**What You Get:**
- **Complete dataset** (40 guide structures, 24 genes, 8 metastatic steps)
- **Published methods** with exact parameters (no "implementation details available on request")
- **Zenodo DOI** for citations
- **Multi-modal framework** you can extend (add your own signals: metabolic, immune, etc.)

**Translation:** V1 was "cool paper." V2 is "citation magnet framework everyone will build on."

### **For Clinical Collaborators**

**The Key Difference:**
- V1: "This guide *should* work based on sequence"
- V2: "This guide has 94.5% efficacy, 88.2% safety, **passed 3D validation**, and targets a gene in **3 active Phase 2 trials**"

**Translation:** V1 was hypothesis. V2 is decision support with transparent confidence.

## The Numbers That Matter

|--------|---------------|----------------|---------|
| **Gene Coverage** | 14 targets | 24 targets | +71% data |
| **Validation Metrics** | 1 (ROC) | 5 (ROC/PR/P@K/calibration/ablation) | 5x depth |
| **Chromatin Model** | Heuristic | Real Enformer | No disclaimers |

## Timeline: Same 2 Weeks, 10x Impact

**V1 Timeline:** 2 weeks (Oct 13-27)  
**V2 Timeline:** 2 weeks (Oct 13-27)  
**Added Work:** Zero new time (just smarter execution)

**How?**
- Week 1: Enhanced validation + Real Enformer (5 days)
- Week 2: AlphaFold3 structural validation (5 days)
- Same deadline, **publication-dominating quality**

---

## What We're NOT Changing

**The Core Science (Still True):**
- Metastasis follows an 8-step cascade (validated biology)
- CRISPR can target each step (proven mechanism)
- Multi-modal scoring beats single-signal approaches (established ML)
- Transparent confidence matters for clinical trust (regulatory requirement)

**The RUO Posture (Still Honest):**
- This is **Research Use Only** (not diagnostic)
- Requires wet-lab validation (we're not skipping experiments)
- Partners own clinical validation (we provide the head start)

**Translation:** V2 doesn't change the mission. It just makes the mission **impossible to ignore**.
