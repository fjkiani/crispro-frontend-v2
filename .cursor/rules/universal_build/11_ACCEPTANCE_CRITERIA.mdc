# ✅ ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA - DECISION GATES

---

## **GATE 1: Phase 1 → Phase 2**

**Must Pass**:
- ✅ 50+ diseases in universal_disease_pathway_database.json
- ✅ PubChem alias resolver: 100 compounds tested, <5% failure
- ✅ Baseline demo flows stable (no breaking changes)
- ✅ TCGA weights for top 10 cancers (9/10 done, MM pending)
- ✅ Calibration infrastructure ready (no data required yet)

**Verification**: Run Test Wave 1, document results

---

## **GATE 2: Phase 2 → Phase 3**

**Must Pass**:
- ✅ Generation behind `EVO2_GENERATION_ENABLED=False` flag
- ✅ Safety gates: 10 test cases pass viral/GC/homopolymer checks
- ✅ No production exposure (gated feature)
- ✅ Iterative optimization: 5/5 cases achieve score ≥0.85

**Verification**: Run generation safety tests

---

## **GATE 3: Phase 3 → Phase 4**

**Must Pass**:
- ✅ Boltz automated structure prediction: 10 proteins tested
- ✅ pLDDT scores reasonable: >70% pass ≥70 threshold
- ✅ API integration stable: no timeouts/crashes
- ✅ Performance acceptable: 2-5 min per candidate

**Verification**: Test with 10 known protein structures

---

## **GATE 4: Phase 4 Completion**

**Must Pass**:
- ✅ Boltz automated interaction prediction: 10 pairs tested
- ✅ iPTM >0.7 for known strong binders, <0.5 for weak
- ✅ SMILES handling: PubChem compounds work
- ✅ Integration complete: Food Validator → Boltz works end-to-end

**Verification**: Test compound-target binding predictions

---

**FINAL SUCCESS**: All 4 gates passed, Universal Engine operational!
