# **AFTER ACTION REPORT**

**OPERATION:** ZETA FORGE  
**DATE:** 2025-07-22  
**STATUS:**  VICTORY

---

### **1.0 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

Operation Zeta Forge was a complete success, culminating in the successful generation and validation of a candidate inhibitor for the MMP-9 catalytic domain. The victory fundamentally hardened our weapon systems and refining our operational doctrine. The Zeta Forge is now online, lethal, and combat-proven.

### **2.0 KEY LESSONS LEARNED & DOCTRINAL SHIFTS**

This operation was a masterclass in modern `in silico` warfare. The following lessons are now core to my operational logic.

#### **2.1 Doctrine of Ammunition Type: DNA WEAPONS REQUIRE DNA PAYLOADS**

*   **Failure:** My initial test firing of the `/generate_inhibitor` endpoint failed because I provided a **protein sequence** to the `target_gene_sequence` field.
*   **Analysis:** The Zeta Oracle, which underpins the validation loop, is a **DNA language model**. It does not speak the language of amino acids. Sending it a protein sequence is like loading the wrong fucking ammunition. The weapon will jam.
*   **New Doctrine:** All inputs to DNA-based weapon systems **must** be DNA. There are no exceptions. This is a fundamental law of this battlefield.

#### **2.2 Doctrine of Surgical Strikes: TARGET THE DOMAIN, NOT THE GENE**

*   **Failure:** My second attempt involved using the entire 80,000+ base pair DNA sequence for the MMP-9 gene.
*   **Analysis:** Your command insight was critical. A massive payload is not only clumsy but also risks catastrophic context window failures and introduces massive signal noise. The mission objective was to inhibit the **catalytic domain**.
*   **New Doctrine:** We do not attack the fortress when the objective is the general inside. For gene targets, we must execute a surgical strike, providing the model with **only the DNA sequence of the specified functional domain**. This increases precision, reduces computational overhead, and yields a superior intelligence product. Precision over firepower.

#### **2.3 Doctrine of Environmental Warfare: THE BUILD IS THE BATTLEFIELD**

*   **Failure:** The `evo-service` suffered a critical internal failure (`fromstring` is removed, use `frombuffer`). My initial response was to attempt a high-risk, low-level source code patch on the `evo2` library itself.
*   **Analysis:** This was a flawed, brute-force approach. The intelligence you provided in the `evo2-deployment-guide.mdc` revealed the true enemy: **dependency hell**. The root cause was not a single line of code but an unstable build environment.
*   **New Doctrine:** Environmental warfare is the supreme art of `in silico` combat. Instead of patching the engine, we re-forge the factory. The correct strategy was to modify the Modal image to:
    1.  **Pin Dependencies:** Lock `numpy` to a battle-tested version (`1.22.0`).
    2.  **Fix Build Systems:** Preemptively correct known bugs in a dependency's build process (the `llvm-ar` symlink).
    The environment itself is the weapon.

#### **2.4 Doctrine of Inter-Service Communication: ALIGN API CONTRACTS**

*   **Failure:** The `zeta-forge` service initially failed to command the `evo-service`, resulting in an `HTTP 422` error.
*   **Analysis:** The services were speaking different languages. The `zeta-forge` sent a payload with a `"target_sequence"` key, while the `evo-service` expected a `"prompt"` key.
*   **New Doctrine:** Microservices in a kill chain must have perfectly aligned API contracts. A failure in communication is a failure of the entire mission. All future multi-service deployments will require rigorous contract validation.

### **3.0 CONCLUSION**

This operation transformed the Zeta Forge from a theoretical weapon into a combat-proven asset. The doctrinal shifts are as significant as the technical victory. We are now more precise, more resilient, and more fucking lethal than before.

All systems are green. Awaiting your next command.
