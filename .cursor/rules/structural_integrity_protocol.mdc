# DOCTRINE: THE STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY PROTOCOL

## I. MISSION DIRECTIVE

Our previous doctrine was flawed. It produced weapons that were grammatically correct in the 1D world of DNA but physically useless in the 3D world of protein physics, resulting in the "wet noodle" failure. The Structural Integrity Protocol is the new law. Its purpose is to ensure every weapon we forge is not only biologically literate but also structurally sound and capable of holding its shape under fire.

## II. THE THREE-PHASE KILL CHAIN

The protocol is a mandatory, three-phase assault orchestrated by the `CommandCenter`.

### PHASE I: THE FORGE (Sequence Generation) 🧬

*   **Objective:** Generate a diverse slate of candidate therapeutic protein sequences.
*   **Action:** The `CommandCenter` tasks the `UnifiedOracle` (`/invoke` with `action: "generate"`) to create 100 raw DNA candidates based on a `target_motif` from the `Hunter-Analyst`.
*   **Output:** A list of 100 raw DNA-coded candidate weapons.

### PHASE II: THE SIEVE (1D Oracle Validation) 🧪

*   **Objective:** To rapidly filter out "biologically illiterate" candidates that are grammatically incorrect at the sequence level. This is our first line of defense against wasting resources.
*   **Action:** The `CommandCenter` executes a massively parallel scoring operation. All 100 candidates are simultaneously evaluated by the `UnifiedOracle` (`/invoke` with `action: "score"`) against the original `target_motif`.
*   **Metric:** The `delta_score` is the critical metric. It quantifies the "unnaturalness" of the generated sequence.
*   **Rule of Engagement:** Any candidate with a `delta_score` below a defined threshold (e.g., -5.0) is immediately discarded.
*   **Output:** A filtered list of ~50 candidates that have passed 1D stability validation.

### PHASE III: THE GAUNTLET (3D Structural Validation) ⚔️

*   **Objective:** To subject the surviving candidates to the brutal reality of 3D physics and eliminate any "wet noodles."
*   **Action:**
    1.  **The Bridge:** Candidates are translated from DNA to protein sequences internally by the `CommandCenter`.
    2.  **The Dispatch:** The protein sequences are dispatched to a structural prediction engine (e.g., AlphaFold/Boltz).
*   **Metric:** The `pLDDT` score (Predicted Local Distance Difference Test) is the final arbiter of quality. It measures the confidence of the 3D structure prediction.
*   **Rule of Engagement:** Any candidate with an average `pLDDT` score below 70 is immediately fucking discarded.
*   **Output:** A final list of structurally viable protein weapons, ranked by their `pLDDT` score, stored in a JSON artifact for final review.

## III. GUIDING METRICS & SUCCESS CRITERIA

*   **Sieve Survival Rate:** A leading indicator of the Forge's generative health. If < 30% of candidates pass The Sieve, the generation parameters must be re-calibrated.
*   **Final `pLDDT` Score:** The ultimate measure of a successful campaign. The primary objective is to produce candidates with `pLDDT` > 70, with elite weapons scoring > 90.
