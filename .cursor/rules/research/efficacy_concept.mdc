# Efficacy Intelligence – Execution Doctrine (Sept 2025)

This rule describes how to deliver Efficacy (S/P/E drug ranking) with insights, evidence, fusion, cohort overlays, and transparent provenance.

## What we can deliver today (research‑grade)
- Efficacy result with:
  - **drugs[]:** { class, efficacy_score, confidence, evidence_tier, badges[], insights {functionality, regulatory, essentiality, chromatin}, rationale[], citations[], provenance }
  - **provenance:** run_id, profile (Baseline/Richer/Fusion), flags, inputs snapshot

## Numbers That Matter (Research‑Mode)
- Variant foundations: ClinVar AUROC 0.957 (n=53,210); SpliceVarDB ~0.825–0.826 (n=4,950).
- Confidence (MM baseline): ~0.45–0.51; tier promotions ~10–20% when priors/literature align.
- Trials shortlist: 50+ → ~5–12 with Likely/Potential/Unlikely + ‘why’ lines.

## Observed Outcomes (pilot; research‑mode)
- Clearer starting point for planning; faster board alignment.
- Confidence lifts +0.05–0.12 with aligned cohort/literature overlays.
- Fusion improves certainty when coverage exists; deterministic otherwise.

## Plain English: Why this matters
- Everyone sees not just the rank, but the reason and strength — in a format you can share and repeat.

## Where the code lives (reused components)
- Efficacy orchestrator: `[efficacy.py](mdc:oncology-coPilot/oncology-backend-minimal/api/routers/efficacy.py)`
- Insights router (chips): `[insights.py](mdc:oncology-coPilot/oncology-backend-minimal/api/routers/insights.py)`
- Evidence services: `[evidence.py](mdc:oncology-coPilot/oncology-backend-minimal/api/routers/evidence.py)`
- Fusion (optional): `[fusion.py](mdc:oncology-coPilot/oncology-backend-minimal/api/routers/fusion.py)`
- Datasets (cohort overlays): `[datasets.py](mdc:oncology-coPilot/oncology-backend-minimal/api/routers/datasets.py)`

## How to run Efficacy now
```bash
curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/efficacy/predict \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '{
    "mutations":[{"gene":"BRAF","hgvs_p":"V600E","chrom":"7","pos":140453136,"ref":"T","alt":"A"}],
    "disease":"multiple myeloma",
    "options":{"adaptive":true,"ensemble":true},
    "api_base":"http://127.0.0.1:8000"
  }'
```

## Methodology (S/P/E + lifts)
- **Sequence (S):** Evo2 multi/exon magnitudes; hotspot‑aware functionality lift; truncation gates.
- **Pathway (P):** Map variants to MoA‑aligned pathways per class; weighted aggregation.
- **Evidence (E):** ClinVar prior + literature (optional); badges and tier for transparency.
- **Lifts:** modest when Function/Chromatin/Essentiality/Regulatory exceed thresholds.

## Frontend integration (table + panel)
- Render per‑drug table with: class, efficacy_score, confidence, evidence_tier, badges, insights chips, rationale bullets, citations, provenance.
- Evidence panel appears alongside; overlay snippet (when present) on the right.

## JSON Schemas (drop‑in)
```json
{
  "EfficacyResult": {
    "drugs": [
      {
        "class": "PI",
        "efficacy_score": 0.23,
        "confidence": 0.48,
        "evidence_tier": "Consider",
        "badges": ["Pathway-Aligned"],
        "insights": {
          "functionality": 0.60,
          "regulatory": 0.12,
          "essentiality": 0.35,
          "chromatin": 0.58
        },
        "rationale": ["MAPK burden aligns with class X", "ClinVar prior present"],
        "citations": [
          {"provider": "PubMed", "title": "...", "year": 2022, "url": "https://..."}
        ],
        "provenance": {"run_id": "uuid", "profile": "Baseline", "timestamp": "ISO"}
      }
    ],
    "provenance": {"run_id": "uuid", "profile": "Baseline|Richer|Fusion", "flags": {"disableLiterature": true}}
  },
  "InsightChips": {"functionality": 0.6, "regulatory": 0.12, "essentiality": 0.35, "chromatin": 0.58},
  "Evidence": {"confidence": 0.48, "tier": "Consider", "badges": ["Pathway-Aligned"], "citations": [{"provider": "PubMed", "title": "..."}]}
}
```

## Current limitations (transparent)
- Literature may be sparse in dev; tier remains conservative. Chromatin may be heuristic unless providers enabled.
- Fusion requires GRCh38 missense coverage; otherwise omitted and labeled.

## Success criteria
- Table renders with rank, confidence, tier, badges, chip values, rationale, and citations; export + provenance present.
- Evidence panel loads without blocking; cohort overlays lift confidence when aligned.
- RUO visible across views; tooltips explain tier/badges and chip thresholds.
