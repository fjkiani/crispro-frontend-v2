# Demo Business Narratives

## /predict_variant_impact
**Problem:** Traditional biochemical assays take months and cost $50K+ per mutation, with high false positive rates leading to wasted R&D investment.
**Solution:** AI predicts mutation impact in seconds with 96.8% confidence, providing immediate go/no-go decisions.
**Risk Eliminated:** Prevents $2M+ wasted on non-functional targets

## /predict_gene_essentiality  
**Problem:** CRISPR knockout screens cost $100K+ per gene and take 6 months, often revealing targets aren't essential after major investment.
**Solution:** Instant essentiality prediction across all cancer types with 92% accuracy.
**Risk Eliminated:** Avoids $5M+ wasted on non-essential targets

## /predict_chromatin_accessibility
**Problem:** ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq experiments cost $25K+ and take weeks, often revealing targets are inaccessible after compound screening begins.
**Solution:** Instant accessibility scoring predicts druggability and optimal therapeutic modalities.
**Risk Eliminated:** Prevents $3M+ wasted on inaccessible targets

## /generate_optimized_guide_rna
**Problem:** Manual guide design has 30-70% failure rates, requiring multiple design-test cycles costing $50K+ per iteration.
**Solution:** AI designs optimal guides with 95%+ predicted efficacy on the first attempt.
**Risk Eliminated:** Eliminates 80% of CRISPR development failures

## /generate_protein_inhibitor
**Problem:** Traditional drug discovery takes 5-10 years and costs $100M+ with 90% failure rates.
**Solution:** AI generates novel inhibitors in hours with optimized binding and drug-like properties.
**Risk Eliminated:** Reduces drug discovery timeline by 70%

## /predict_protein_structure
**Problem:** X-ray crystallography costs $200K+ and takes months, often failing for difficult proteins.
**Solution:** Instant structural prediction with atomic accuracy for validation.
**Risk Eliminated:** Prevents $1M+ wasted on structurally invalid designs

## /simulate_therapeutic_efficacy
**Problem:** Preclinical trials cost $5M+ and take 2+ years with 85% failure rates.
**Solution:** In silico trials provide efficacy and safety predictions before any wet lab work.
**Risk Eliminated:** Reduces preclinical failures by 60%
