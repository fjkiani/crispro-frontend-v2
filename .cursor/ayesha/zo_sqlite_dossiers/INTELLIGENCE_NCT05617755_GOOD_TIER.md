## 🎯 WHY THIS TRIAL IS A GOOD FIT FOR AYESHA (LLM Analysis)

### **Clinical Trial Analysis: NCT05617755**

**Note**: This is a structured fallback analysis (LLM unavailable).

#### **1. Drug Mechanism Fit**
The trial "AB-1015, an Integrated Circuit T (ICT) Cell Therapy in Patients With Platinum Resistant Epithelial Ovarian Cancer" requires detailed mechanism analysis. Review the trial protocol to understand how the investigational drug addresses Ayesha's Stage IVB High-Grade Serous Ovarian Carcinoma with extensive tumor burden and pleural metastases.

#### **2. Location Logistics**
Review trial locations to identify NYC metro sites accessible from ZIP 10029 (East Harlem). Preferred centers: Mount Sinai (local), MSK (2 miles), NYU Langone (3-4 miles).

#### **3. Risk-Benefit for Ayesha**
**Key Considerations**:
- Pulmonary compromise: Large bilateral pleural effusions require careful monitoring
- ECOG 1: Acceptable for most trials, but toxicity profile is critical
- Tumor burden: Extensive disease (CA-125 >2800) may require aggressive initial treatment

#### **4. Comparison to Standard of Care**
Ayesha's planned SOC is Carboplatin + Paclitaxel + Bevacizumab (NCCN-guideline first-line therapy for Stage IVB HGSOC, BRCA wildtype). This trial should be compared to this regimen to assess:
- Is it a replacement for SOC (frontline trial)?
- Is it additional to SOC (maintenance trial)?
- Is it an alternative if SOC fails?

#### **5. Critical Considerations**
1. **Biomarker testing**: HER2 and HRD status are unknown - may be required for enrollment
2. **Timing**: When should Ayesha enroll? Before SOC, during SOC, or after response?
3. **Clinical team review**: Discuss with Ayesha's oncologist before enrollment decisions

**Recommendation**: Full protocol review with clinical team required.

## 🚨 CRITICAL DECISION TREE FOR AYESHA

START: Ayesha completes carboplatin + paclitaxel + bevacizumab (L1)
  │
  ├─→ Biomarker Testing (if required)
  │    │
  │    └─→ **ELIGIBLE FOR TRIAL!** (pending results)
  │         Probability: ~100%
  │
  └─→ END: Enroll in NCT05617755

## 💡 STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS

### Best-Case Scenario:
✅ Ayesha enrolls in NCT05617755
✅ Access to experimental therapy
✅ Close monitoring, expert care
**Probability**: ~100%

### Most Likely Scenario:
Ayesha completes screening and enrolls successfully (pending biomarkers)

### Challenge Scenario:
Screen failure due to biomarker requirements or other eligibility criteria

## 📋 FULL ELIGIBILITY TEXT

### Eligibility Criteria
* Recurrent, advanced, platinum resistant ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer and must have a histological diagnosis of a high-grade serous histology.
* a) Platinum resistant disease is defined as progression of disease within six months of platinum regimen.
* Doubling of cancer antigen 125 (CA-125) level on 2 successive measurements may be considered as meeting the definition of disease progression
* b) Have received at least 2 lines of prior therapy including a platinum-based regimen if eligible and a poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor if BRCA1/2 mutated. No more than 3 lines of prior therapy for the treatment of platinum resistant disease is permitted.
* Adequate organ function as per protocol definitions.
* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score 0 or 1.
* Evaluable disease (dose escalation cohorts) or measurable disease (backfill cohorts) at time of enrollment as per protocol definitions.
* Negative pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential. Women of non-childbearing potential are those who have been surgically sterilized, have medically confirmed ovarian failure, or have not had menses within the past 12 months. * Cytotoxic chemotherapy within 14 days of time of cell collection.
* Cytotoxic chemotherapy within 14 days of starting of conditioning chemotherapy.
* New York Heart Association functional class II-IV cardiovascular disability
* Clinically significant pericardial effusion
* Pleural or peritoneal effusion that requires drainage for symptom management within 28 days of screening.
* Active autoimmune disease requiring immunosuppressive therapy or uncontrolled with treatment.
* Untreated brain metastasis.
* Subjects unwilling to participate in an extended safety monitoring period.

## 📊 TRIAL DESCRIPTION

This is a multi-center, open-label phase 1 dose escalation trial that uses a modified 3+3 design to identify a recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of AB-1015 cell product. Backfill cohorts will enroll additional subjects at doses deemed to be safe for a total enrollment of up to 12 subjects per each backfill cohort on the protocol.

## 🏥 LOCATION DETAILS

### NYC Metro Locations (Priority for Ayesha)

1. **Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center** - New York, New York

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL GATES FOR AYESHA

✅ No critical biomarker gates identified. Proceed with standard eligibility screening.

---

## ⚔️ TACTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS

**Priority**: ⚠️ **P1 - HIGH PRIORITY** (Eligibility: ~100%)

**Next Steps**:
1. **Review eligibility carefully** (with oncologist)
2. **Order pending biomarker tests** (if required)
3. **Contact trial site** (within 1 week)
4. **Backup option** (if top-tier trials fail)


---

## 🎯 VALUE PROPOSITION

**WIN-WIN SCENARIO**:
- If eligible (100% chance) → Access to experimental therapy
- If not eligible → Gets proven SOC (PARP or bevacizumab maintenance)
- Either way, Ayesha receives appropriate care

**Risk-Benefit**: Low risk (pre-screening doesn't commit to enrollment), high reward (cutting-edge therapy)
