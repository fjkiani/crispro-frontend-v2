## 🧬 **PART 1: THEORETICAL FOUNDATION**

### **1.1 Causes of Cancer**
- **Primary Cause:** Glucose (Warburg Effect)
- **Contributing Factors:**
  - Chronic inflammation
  - Carcinogenic compounds
  - Oxidative stress
  - Weak immune system
  - Hormonal imbalances
  - Gut dysbiosis

### **1.2 The Warburg Effect**
**Key Concept:** Cancer cells prefer glycolysis over oxidative phosphorylation, even when oxygen is present.

**Implications:**
- Cancer cells feed on glucose (high blood sugar)
- Fat requires oxygen (oxidative phosphorylation) → less preferred by cancer cells
- Low-carb/ketogenic diet can starve cancer cells

### **1.3 Dietary Strategies**
- **Starve Cancer:** Low-carb, ketogenic foods (avocado, leafy greens, olive oil, butter, coconut oil)
- **Reduce Inflammation:** Garlic, turmeric, ginger, berries, fatty fish, broccoli, dark chocolate
- **Support Immunity:** Garlic, ginger, mushrooms (beta-glucan), bell peppers (vitamin C)
- **Balance Hormones:** Low-carb diet, broccoli (indole-3-carbinol), healthy fats
- **Gut Health:** Fermented foods (sauerkraut, kimchi, yogurt), prebiotics (asparagus, onion, garlic, leafy greens)

### **1.4 Anti-Processed Foods**
- **90% rule:** 90% of diet should be non-processed foods
- **Harmful effects:** Sugar, white flour, artificial chemicals, endocrine disruptors, gut dysbiosis

### **Food 5: Pomegranates** 🍇
**Compound:** Ellagitannins (tannins)  
**Mechanisms:**
- Cut off blood supply to tumors (anti-angiogenic)
- Starve cancer
- Slow PSA rise (prostate cancer marker)
- Anti-androgenic (harder for prostate cancer to grow)
- Stimulate colon to produce mucus → nurture Akkermansia muciniphila (healthy gut bacteria)
- Lower inflammation
- Strengthen immune system

**Evidence:**
- Clinical studies: Pomegranate juice helped keep PSA levels stable in men with prostate cancer

**Testable Claims:**
- Ellagitannins → anti-angiogenic effect (VEGF pathway)
- Ellagitannins → anti-androgenic effect (androgen receptor pathway)
- Ellagitannins → PSA reduction (prostate cancer)
- Ellagitannins → gut microbiome modulation (Akkermansia muciniphila)
- Ellagitannins → immune system strengthening
