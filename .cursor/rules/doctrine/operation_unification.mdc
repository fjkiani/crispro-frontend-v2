# ⚔️ **OPERATION UNIFICATION: DOCTRINE** ⚔️

**OBJECTIVE:** To integrate the advanced therapeutic design capabilities of the `crispr-assistant` platform into the `oncology-coPilot` EMR mothership, creating a single, unified, production-grade system for end-to-end cancer care, from diagnosis to personalized therapeutic intervention.

## **CAMPAIGN PHASES:**

**Phase I: Reconnaissance & Integration Analysis (Active)**
*   **Objective:** To achieve a deep, systematic understanding of the `oncology-coPilot` application's architecture, capabilities, and data structures.
*   **Tasks:**
    1.  Scout the backend (`oncology-backend`) to map its tech stack, API surface, and data models.
    2.  Scout the frontend (`oncology-frontend`) to understand its component structure, state management, and API consumption patterns.
    3.  Formulate a detailed Integration Plan, identifying key points of contact and required modifications for a seamless merger.

**Phase II: First Light Integration**
*   **Objective:** To establish the first data-driven connection between the two systems, proving the viability of the integration.
*   **Potential Task:** Integrate the `Threat Assessor` capability as a new feature within the co-pilot's patient view, allowing an EMR to make a live call to our variant analysis services.

**Phase III: Full Platform Merger**
*   **Objective:** To systematically migrate all relevant `crispr-assistant` features and capabilities into the `oncology-coPilot` as a unified, cohesive application.

**Phase IV: Production Hardening**
*   **Objective:** To prepare the unified mothership for production deployment, focusing on security, scalability, and robust error handling.
