   ASSAY INFORMATION
Methodology: The CustomNext-Cancer® +RNAinsight® test is a customizable screen of up to 91 genes associated with hereditary cancer predisposition. Genomic deoxyribonucleic acid (gDNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) are isolated from the patient’s specimen using standardized methodology and quantified. RNA is converted to complementary DNA (cDNA) by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Sequence enrichment of the targeted coding exons and adjacent intronic nucleotides is carried out by a bait-capture methodology using long biotinylated oligonucleotide probes followed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Next-Generation sequencing. Additional DNA analyses include Sanger sequencing for any regions missing or with insufficient read depth coverage for reliable heterozygous variant detection. Variants in regions complicated by pseudogene interference, variant calls not satisfying depth of coverage and variant allele frequency quality thresholds, and potentially homozygous variants are verified by Sanger sequencing. For BRCA2 and MSH2, the Portuguese founder mutation, c.156_157insAlu (also known as 384insAlu), and the coding exons 1-7 inversion, respectively, are detected by next generation sequencing and confirmed by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) or PCR and agarose gel electrophoresis. Gross deletion/duplication analysis for ordered genes (excluding AXIN2, CASR, CFTR, CPA1, CTNNA1, CTRC, EGFR, EGLN1, FAM175A (ABRAXAS1), HOXB13, KIT, MITF, MLH3, MSH3, PALLD, PDGFRA, POLD1, POLE, PRSS1, PMS2, RINT1, RPS20, SPINK1, and TERT) is performed using a custom pipeline based on read-depth from NGS data and/or targeted chromosomal microarray with confirmatory MLPA when applicable. For PMS2, gross deletion/duplication analysis is performed using MLPA kit P008-B1. If a deletion is detected in exons 13, 14, or 15 of PMS2, double stranded sequencing of the appropriate exon(s) of the pseudogene PMS2CL will be performed to determine if the deletion is located in the PMS2 gene or pseudogene. NCBI reference sequences are as follows: AIP- NM_003977.2, ALK- NM_004304.4, APC- NM_000038.5 & NM_001127511.2, ATM- NM_000051.3, AXIN2- NM_004655.3, BAP1- NM_004656.2, BARD1- NM_000465.2, BLM- NM_000057.2, BMPR1A- NM_004329.2, BRCA1- NM_007294.3, BRCA2- NM_000059.3, BRIP1- NM_032043.2, CASR- NM_000388.3, CDC73- NM_024529.4, CDH1- NM_004360.3, CDK4- NM_000075.3, CDKN1B- NM_004064, CDKN2A- NM_000077.4 and NM_058195.3 (p14ARF), CFTR- NM_000492.3, CHEK2- NM_007194.3, CPA1- NM_001868.2, CTNNA1- NM_001903.2, CTRC- NM_007272.2, DICER1- NM_177438.2, EGFR- NM_005228.3, EGLN1- NM_022051.2, FAM175A (ABRAXAS1)- NM_139076.2, FANCC- NM_000136.2, FH- NM_000143.3, FLCN- NM_144997.5, GALNT12- NM_024642.4, HOXB13- NM_006361.5, KIF1B- NM_015074.3, KIT- NM_000222.2, LZTR1- NM_006767.3, MAX- NM_002382.3, MEN1- NM_130799.2, MET- NM_000245.1, MITF- NM_000248.3, MUTYH- NM_001128425.1, MRE11A- NM_005591.3, MLH1- NM_000249.3, MLH3- NM_001040108.1, MSH2- NM_000251.1, MSH3- NM_002439.3, MSH6- NM_000179.2, NBN- NM_002485.4, NF1- NM_000267.3, NF2- NM_000268.3, NTHL1- NM_002528.5, PALB2- NM_024675.3, PALLD- NM_001166110.1, PDGFRA- NM_006206.4, PHOX2B- NM_003924.3, PMS2- NM_000535.5, POLD1- NM_002691.2, POLE- NM_006231.2, POT1- NM_015450.2, PRKAR1A- NM_002734.3, PRSS1- NM_002769.4, PTCH1- NM_000264.3, PTEN- NM_000314.4, RAD50- NM_005732.3, RAD51C- NM_058216.1, RAD51D- NM_002878.3, RB1- NM_000321.2, RECQL- NM_002907.3, RET- NM_020975.4, RINT1- NM_021930.4, RPS20- NM_001023.3, SDHA- NM_004168.2, SDHAF2- NM_017841.2, SDHB- NM_003000.2, SDHC- NM_003001.3, SDHD- NM_003002.2, SMAD4- NM_005359.5, SMARCA4- NM_001128849.1, SMARCB1- NM_003073.3, SMARCE1- NM_003079.4, SPINK1- NM_003122.3, STK11- NM_000455.4, SUFU- NM_016169.3, TERT- NM_198253.2, TMEM127- NM_017849.3, TP53- NM_000546.4, TSC1- NM_000368.4, TSC2- NM_000548.3, VHL- NM_000551.3, XRCC2- NM_005431.1.
Analytical Range: The CustomNext-Cancer® +RNAinsight® test detects variants in up to 89 genes by either Next-Generation or Sanger sequencing of all coding domains and well into the flanking 5’ and 3’ ends of all the introns and untranslated regions. Unless explicitly stated, sequence and copy number variants in the promoter, non-coding exons or 3’ untranslated regions are not routinely reported. For HOXB13, only variants impacting codon 84 are routinely reported. For MITF, only the status of the c.952G>A (p.E318K) alteration is analyzed and reported. For EGFR, only the status of the c.2369C>T (p.T790M) and c.2327G>A (p.R776H) alterations are analyzed and reported. ForPALLD, only the status of the variant c.451C>T (p.P139S) is analyzed and reported. For FAM175A (ABRAXAS1), only the status of the variant c.1082G>A (p.R361Q) is analyzed and reported. For TERT, only the status of the promoter variant c.-57A>C is analyzed and reported. ForRPS20, missense variants are not routinely reported. For POLD1 and POLE, only missense variants and in-frame insertions/deletions in the exonuclease domains (codons 311- 541 and 269-485, respectively) are routinely reported. For ALK, only variants located within the kinase domain (c.3286-c.4149) are reported. For EGLN1, only missense variants within the catalytic domain (codons 188-418) are reported. ForRECQL, only missense variants in the helicase and RCQ domains (codons 63-592) and exonic truncating variants are routinely reported. For PDGFRA, only missense variants or in-frame insertion/deletions located in coding exons 9, 11, 13, and 17 are reported. For KIT, only missense variants or in-frame insertion/deletions located in coding exons 8, 9, 11, 13, and 17 are reported. The MSH3 and the PHOX2B polyalanine repeat regions are excluded from analysis. Gross deletion/duplication analysis determines gene copy number for the covered exons and untranslated regions of ordered genes (excluding AXIN2, CASR, CFTR, CPA1, CTNNA1, CTRC, EGFR, EGLN1, FAM175A (ABRAXAS1), HOXB13, KIT, MITF, MLH3, MSH3, PALLD, PDGFRA, POLD1, POLE, PRSS1, RINT1, RPS20, SPINK1, and TERT). For GREM1, only the status of the 40kb 5’UTR gross duplication is analyzed and reported. For EPCAM, only gross deletions encompassing the 3’ end of the gene are reported. ForNTHL1, only full-gene gross deletions and duplications are detected. For APC, all promoter 1B gross deletions as well as single nucleotide substitutions within the promoter 1B YY1 binding motif (NM_001127511 c.-196_-186.) are analyzed and reported. RNA transcripts are screened and compared to a human reference pool. The presence of RNA transcripts meeting quality thresholds is incorporated as evidence towards assessment and classification of DNA variants. Any regions not meeting RNA quality thresholds, including regions with chronically low expression in human peripheral lymphocytes, are excluded from analysis. RNA transcripts derived from genes with limited gene-disease validity or with an inconsistent mechanism of disease do not routinely contribute to variant interpretation.
Result Reports: Results reported herein may be of constitutional or somatic origin. This methodology cannot differentiate between these possibilities. DNA alterations in the following classifications are always reported:

Disclaimer: This test was developed and its performance characteristics were determined by Ambry Genetics Corporation. It has not been cleared or approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. The FDA does not require this test to go through premarket FDA review. It should not be regarded as investigational or for research. This test should be interpreted in context with other clinical findings. This report does not represent medical advice. Any questions, suggestions, or concerns regarding interpretation of results should be forwarded to a genetic counselor, medical geneticist, or physician skilled in interpretation of the relevant medical literature. This laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) as qualified to perform high complexity clinical laboratory testing. This test analyzes the following types of mutations: nucleotide substitutions, small deletions (up to 25 bp), small insertions (up to 10 bp), small indels and gross deletions/duplications. Unless otherwise noted in the methodology section above, it is not intended to analyze the following types of alterations: gross rearrangements, deep intronic variations, Alu element insertions, and other unknown abnormalities. The pattern of mutation types varies with the gene tested and this test detects a high but variable percentage of known and unknown mutants of the classes stated. A negative result from the analysis cannot rule out the possibility that the tested individual carries a rare unexamined mutation or mutation in the undetectable group. This test is designed and validated to be capable of detecting ~99% of described mutations in the 91 orderable genes on the test (analytical sensitivity). The clinical sensitivity of this test may vary widely according to the specific clinical and family history. Cancer is a complex clinical disorder. Mutations in other genes or the regions not analyzed by this test can also give rise to similar clinical conditions. Although molecular tests are highly accurate, rare diagnostic errors may occur. Possible diagnostic errors include sample mix-up, erroneous paternity identification, technical errors, clerical errors, and genotyping errors. Genotyping errors can result from trace contamination of PCR reactions, from maternal cell contamination in fetal samples, from rare genetic variants that interfere with analysis, germline or somatic mosaicism, presence of pseudogenes, technical difficulties in regions with high GC content or homopolymer tracts, active hematologic disease, a history of allogeneic bone marrow or peripheral stem cell transplant, or from other sources. Rare variants present in the human genome reference sequence (GRCh37.p5/hg19) or rare misalignment due to presence of pseudogenes can lead to misinterpretation of patient sequence data.
