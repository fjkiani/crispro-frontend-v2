# Patent Development Guidelines

## Sequence Listing Requirements

### When Sequence Listings Are Required
Based on patent law requirements, CrisPRO's patent application **likely does NOT require** a formal Sequence Listing because:

1. **No Specific Novel Sequences**: We don't claim novel guide RNA sequences, nucleases, or specific therapeutic sequences
2. **Platform Focus**: Our invention is the *platform/system* for designing and optimizing CRISPR therapeutics, not specific sequences
3. **Method Claims**: Primary claims focus on computational methods, AI algorithms, and system architecture

### Sequence References in Claims
However, we do reference sequences in our platform. Handle these appropriately:

```patent-language
// Acceptable reference format in claims
"A method for analyzing guide RNA sequences comprising..."
"wherein said guide RNA sequence is selected from sequences having 17-24 nucleotides..."
"wherein said nuclease is selected from Cas9, Cas12a, Cas13, base editors, and prime editors..."

// Avoid specific sequences that would trigger listing requirements
// Don't include: "wherein said guide RNA has the sequence SEQ ID NO: 1: ATCGATCG..."
```

### Documentation Strategy
- **Reference existing sequences**: Cite published sequences and databases (e.g., "Cas9 having the sequence as published in Jinek et al., Science 2012")
- **Functional descriptions**: Use functional language rather than specific sequences
- **Example sequences**: Include in specification as examples, not limiting claims

## Patent Claim Strategy

### Primary Claim Categories

#### 1. System Claims

  (c) a digital twin simulation core configured to predict cellular and therapeutic outcomes;
  (d) a nuclease/editor library containing characterization data for multiple CRISPR systems;
  (e) a processor configured to execute said AI agents to generate therapeutic recommendations.
```

#### 2. Method Claims  
```patent-language

  (c) simulating corrective editing outcomes using a cellular risk model;
  (d) generating a prophylactic intervention strategy optimized for long-term safety;

1. **Broad system claims** (Claim 1)
2. **Key method claims** for core innovations
3. **Specific implementation claims** for unique features
4. **Dependent claims** adding specific details and alternatives

### Claim Language Guidelines

#### Use Functional Language
```patent-language
// Good - functional description
"an AI agent configured to analyze guide RNA efficiency scores and generate therapeutic recommendations"

// Avoid - implementation-specific
"a Python script using OpenAI's GPT-4 to analyze CHOPCHOP output files"
```

#### Include Alternative Embodiments
```patent-language
"wherein said AI system comprises one or more of: large language models, neural networks, machine learning algorithms, or expert systems"
```

#### Prophylactic Focus (Key Differentiator)
```patent-language
"wherein said therapeutic goal comprises preventing disease onset in individuals with pathogenic germline variants"
"wherein said cellular risk model predicts disease prevention efficacy before symptom onset"
```
