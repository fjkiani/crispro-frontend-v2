# ⚔️ BRIACELL OUTREACH - FIXED VERSION (NO HALLUCINATIONS)

## **VERSION 1: CONSERVATIVE (TIER 1 - STRATIFICATION)**

**Subject:** Genomic patient stratification for BRIA-ABC Phase 3 (NCT06072612)

Dr. Williams,

I reviewed BriaCell's BRIA-ABC Phase 3 trial and believe our genomic AI platform could help increase trial success probability through patient stratification.

**The Challenge:**

Metastatic breast cancer is heterogeneous. Your trial enrolls patients across HER2+, HER2-, and CNS metastasis populations. Without genomic stratification, response signals may be diluted, reducing statistical power.

**What We Offer:**

Pre-enrollment genomic scoring that predicts:
1. Which patients are most likely to respond to Bria-IMT™ + checkpoint inhibitor
2. Which metastatic pathways are active per patient (CNS vs visceral vs bone)
3. Genomic features associated with checkpoint inhibitor sensitivity

**Our Validation (Published Data):**
- 7 FDA-approved metastatic cancer targets correctly identified (BRAF, VEGFA, MET, CXCR4)
- AUROC 0.976 ± 0.035 discriminating drug-relevant genes from non-relevant
- Metastasis prediction framework validated on 56 gene-step combinations

**Specific Value for BriaCell:**

*Scenario 1: Increase statistical power*
- If we identify a 30% patient subgroup with 2× response rate, adaptive randomization could reduce required sample size by 20-30%

*Scenario 2: Companion diagnostic*
- Genomic signature becomes a companion diagnostic for Bria-IMT™ label (precision oncology positioning)

*Scenario 3: CNS metastasis biomarker*
- Secondary endpoint (CNS event-free survival) could yield publishable biomarker for brain metastasis risk

**Proposal:**

6-week pilot on 50-100 patients ($250K):
- Genomic analysis of trial patients (RNA-seq or WES)
- Response prediction model with cross-validation
- Biomarker discovery report (20 pages + presentation)
- Expected outcome: Identify high-responder subgroup with ≥70% predicted response

**Next Step:**

Would you be open to a 20-minute discovery call to discuss whether genomic stratification fits your trial strategy?

**P.S.** If patient genomic data isn't available yet, we can start with a retrospective analysis of your Phase 2 cohort to demonstrate predictive value before enrolling Phase 3.

## **VERSION 2: MODERATE (TIER 2 - COMBINATION ENHANCEMENT)**

**Subject:** CRISPR combination strategy for Bria-IMT™ resistance prevention

Dr. Williams,

Your Bria-IMT™ approach (GM-CSF priming + checkpoint inhibitor) is innovative for heating cold tumors. I'm reaching out because our platform identifies which metastatic drivers to target with CRISPR to prevent resistance.

**The Opportunity:**

Even with Bria-IMT™ priming, some patients won't respond due to:
1. Intrinsic checkpoint inhibitor resistance (PD-L1 loss, MHC-I defects)
2. Active metastatic escape pathways (CXCR4, MMP2, VEGFA)
3. Immune exclusion (stromal barriers)

**What We Offer:**

CRISPR guide design targeting resistance mechanisms:
- 20 guides per target gene (60-100 total)
- Computational validation: efficacy (mean 0.548), safety (mean 0.771)
- Structural validation: AlphaFold pLDDT 80.1 (high confidence)
- Ranked by "Assassin Score" (composite: efficacy + safety + biological relevance)

**Specific Targets for Bria-IMT™ Synergy:**

*Scenario 1: Restore checkpoint sensitivity*
- Target: PD-L1 regulatory elements (if tumor loses expression)
- Expected outcome: Convert resistant patients to responders

*Scenario 2: Block CNS metastasis*
- Targets: CXCR4 (homing), MMP2 (blood-brain barrier), VEGFA (brain colonization)
- Expected outcome: Improve CNS event-free survival (your secondary endpoint)

*Scenario 3: Enhance T-cell infiltration*
- Targets: CXCL10, CCL5 (chemokine gradients)
- Expected outcome: Increase tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs)

**Proposal:**

12-week program ($500K):
- Target selection: Analyze Phase 2 non-responders, identify escape mechanisms
- Guide design: 60 guides for 3 targets
- In vitro validation plan: Assays for your cell lines (we co-fund 50%)
- Expected outcome: 70%+ guides meet production threshold, ready for mouse studies

**Next Step:**

Would you be interested in a technical deep-dive with your R&D team to explore CRISPR combinations for Bria-OTS™ pipeline expansion?

## **VERSION 3: AGGRESSIVE (TIER 3 - CNS PREVENTION CO-DEVELOPMENT)**

**Subject:** Co-development opportunity: CNS metastasis prevention platform

Dr. Williams,

I noticed your Phase 3 trial tracks CNS event-free survival as a key secondary endpoint. We've built the first AI platform targeting all 8 steps of brain metastasis formation, and I believe there's a co-development opportunity.

**The Unmet Need:**

- 30-40% of metastatic breast cancer patients develop brain mets
- CNS metastases are the leading cause of death in HER2+ and TNBC
- No FDA-approved preventive therapy exists (only reactive treatments)

**What We've Built:**

8-step metastatic cascade model with 40 CRISPR-targetable genes:
1. Primary growth → Local invasion → Intravasation → Circulation survival
2. Extravasation → Micrometastasis → Angiogenesis → CNS colonization

Each step has 5 validated targets with computational efficacy/safety scores.

**Specific Opportunity for BriaCell:**

*Phase 1: Biomarker development (6 months, $250K)*
- Analyze your Phase 2/3 cohort
- Identify genomic features predicting CNS metastasis
- Develop companion diagnostic for brain met risk

*Phase 2: CRISPR guide library (12 months, $750K)*
- Design 40 guides targeting CNS cascade
- Validate in your breast cancer cell lines
- Test in mouse xenografts (brain metastasis models)

*Phase 3: IND preparation (18 months, $1M)*
- Bria-CNS™: Bria-IMT + anti-CXCR4 guide (prevent brain seeding)
- Pre-IND meeting materials
- Phase 1/2 trial design (adjuvant setting)

**Expected Outcome:**

If successful, BriaCell would have:
- First CNS metastasis prevention therapy
- Companion diagnostic for patient selection
- Expanded indication beyond current Bria-IMT™ label
- IP co-ownership (platform method = us, therapeutic application = you)

**Business Terms (Proposed):**

- Milestone payments: $250K (Year 1), $750K (Year 2), $1M (Year 3)
- Royalty: 2-5% net sales on CNS prevention indication
- Co-publication rights
- Joint steering committee (quarterly reviews)

**Next Step:**

This is a multi-year partnership discussion. Would you be open to an initial conversation about your CNS metastasis strategy and whether prevention fits your roadmap?

## ✅ **RECOMMENDED APPROACH**

**For First Contact:**
- **Use Version 1** (Conservative/Tier 1)
- **Reason:** Lower barrier, provable claims, clear ROI
- **Goal:** Get discovery call, then upsell to Tier 2/3

**If They Respond Positively:**
- Discovery call → Send Version 2 (Combination) as follow-up
- If they're strategic thinkers → Introduce Version 3 (Co-development)

**If They Push Back on Claims:**
- **Fallback:** "Let us prove it. We'll analyze your Phase 2 cohort for FREE, show predictive value, then discuss Phase 3 stratification."

## 🎯 **PREDICTIVE SCENARIOS (HONEST FRAMING)**

### **Scenario 1: Best Case**
> "If our analysis identifies a 30% patient subgroup with 2× response rate (e.g., high CXCR4 expression), adaptive randomization could reduce your required sample size by 20-30%, saving $5-10M in trial costs."

**Why this works:** Specific mechanism (CXCR4), quantified benefit (2×), measurable savings

### **Scenario 2: Moderate Case**
> "If we discover a genomic signature predicting Bria-IMT™ response with AUROC >0.80, this becomes a companion diagnostic for label expansion, positioning BriaCell for precision oncology market (vs one-size-fits-all immunotherapy)."

**Why this works:** Conditional ("if"), measurable (AUROC), strategic benefit

### **Scenario 3: Conservative Case**
> "At minimum, our analysis provides a publishable biomarker study for your secondary endpoints (CNS-EFS), which supports future trials even if Phase 3 primary endpoint doesn't reach significance."

**Why this works:** Hedge against trial failure, still delivers value
