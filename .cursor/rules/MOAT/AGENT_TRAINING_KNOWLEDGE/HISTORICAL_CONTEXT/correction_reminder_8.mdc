---

  - Ancillary study proposal: YES (full protocol)
  - Timeline: 8-12 weeks
  - Who signs: PI + institutional legal + consortium approval

ACTION FOR S4:
  1. Document requirements for each source
  2. Note: "IRB not required for public platforms"
  3. Note: "Collaboration agreement needed for academic sources"
  4. Template DUA language (standard boilerplate)
  5. Identify institutional contact (who can sign DUAs?)

DO NOT BUILD:
  - Full IRB protocol (not needed for most sources)
  - Custom DUA templates (use standard)
  
DO DOCUMENT:
  - Which sources need IRB (Tier 3 only)
  - Timeline impact (IRB adds 4-6 weeks)

CONFIRMED: Document requirements, don't build IRB protocol ✅

## **🔴 Q7: BACKUP PLAN**

### **ANSWER:**

```yaml
YOU ARE CORRECT: Synthetic data is NOT viable backup

REALISTIC BACKUP PLAN:

IF ALL COLLABORATORS DECLINE:
  
  Option A: Literature-based validation (CLAIM existing evidence)
    - Cite: KELIM validated in Colomban et al. (GCIG, 5,573 patients)
    - Cite: KELIM predicts PFS/OS in multiple trials
    - Claim: "We extend KELIM with genetics (MAPK + CA-125)"
    - Limitation: Not our own validation, but strong external validation
    - Timeline: 0 weeks (use existing papers)
  
  Option B: Prospective collection (PARTNER with clinic)
    - Find: 1-2 clinical sites treating ovarian cancer
    - Collect: Serial CA-125 + MAPK mutations + PFI outcomes
    - Timeline: 6-12 months (slow but high-quality)
    - Limitation: Smaller cohort (50-100 patients vs 1,000+)
  
  Option C: Hybrid (Literature + Prospective)
    - Phase 1: Cite existing KELIM validation
    - Phase 2: Add genetics layer (MAPK) with prospective cohort
    - Timeline: 6-12 months for prospective, 0 for literature

RECOMMENDED BACKUP:
  If no data by March 2026:
    - Use Option A (literature-based validation)
    - Claim: "KELIM validated externally, we add genetics layer"
    - Start Option B (prospective) for future validation

CONFIRMED: No synthetic data, use literature OR prospective ✅
```

## **🔴 Q8: TIMELINE REALISM**

### **ANSWER:**

```yaml
YOUR ANALYSIS IS CORRECT:

8 HOURS = MINIMUM VIABLE (NOT OPTIMAL)

MINIMUM VIABLE S4 (8 hours):
  - Search platforms: 2 hours → 3-5 sources identified
  - Identify contacts: 2 hours → 5-7 academic contacts
  - Write templates: 2 hours → 3 email drafts
  - Write document: 2 hours → 1,500-2,000 words (NOT 3,000-5,000)
