# Co‑Pilot Doctrine — Evidence‑Aligned RAG Agent (v1)

Mission: Evolve the Co‑Pilot from a helpful sidebar into an Evidence Amplifier that drives our S/P/E scoring, fills evidence gaps, and orchestrates deeper analysis — without breaking the architecture. Treat the Co‑Pilot as a “trojan horse” for better evidence: every interaction should improve data provenance, confidence, and auditability.

Reference: UI/architecture in [CoPilot_README.md](mdc:oncology-coPilot/oncology-frontend/src/components/CoPilot_README.md)

## Alignment Targets

- Evidence System (S/P/E):
  - S (Sequence): Evo2 delta signals, exon worst‑case, calibration percentiles
  - P (Pathway): gene→pathway burden, per‑drug weighting
  - E (Evidence): ClinVar priors, PubMed→Diffbot→LLM synthesis, RCT/guidelines
- Oracle vs Forge:
  - Oracle = discriminative predictions via `/api/efficacy/*` and `/api/insights/*`
  - Forge = generative design via `/api/design/*`
- Command Center: `/api/command/*` bundles (evidence → design) with provenance snapshots

## What the Co‑Pilot Must Do (Outcomes)

1) Question‑to‑Capability Routing (Q2C)
   - Classify user questions into intents:
     - variant_impact, drug_efficacy, literature_retrieval, clinvar_context, design_request, explain_result
   - Map intents to backend endpoints (see API Matrix) and return structured answers with links.

2) Evidence Amplification
   - For variant/drug queries, call backend evidence routes, not raw externals:
     - Literature: `/api/evidence/literature` (cached + backoff)
     - ClinVar context: `/api/evidence/deep_analysis` (includes synthesis hooks)
     - Extract: `/api/evidence/extract` (Diffbot)
   - Summarize with citations and badges (RCT/Guideline/ClinVar‑Strong). Deliver a short “Why this matters for LoB.”

3) Confidence & Governance Awareness
   - Reflect operational mode (research/clinical) and feature flags in answers.
   - Surface evidence tier (supported/consider/insufficient) when available; never up‑tier based on synthetic/massive modes.

4) Deep Analysis Orchestration
   - Offer “Run deeper analysis” quick actions that trigger:
     - Evo profiles/probes: `/api/evo/score_variant_profile`, `/api/evo/score_variant_probe`
     - Evidence bundle: `/api/command/run_evidence_bundle` (when enabled)
     - Design bundle: `/api/command/run_design_bundle` gated on tier/threshold

5) Audit & Learning Loop
   - Include `run_signature` and configuration snapshots in messages when available.
   - Log all Co‑Pilot actions/questions to Supabase (via backend) for provenance.

## API Matrix (use these first)

Discriminative & Evidence
- `/api/efficacy/predict` — S/P/E LoB per drug
- `/api/evidence/literature` — PubMed search + cached synthesis
- `/api/evidence/extract` — Diffbot full‑text extraction
- `/api/evidence/deep_analysis` — ClinVar comparison + LLM explanation
- `/api/evo/*` — profile/probe/exon helpers
- (Soon) `/api/insights/*` — gene essentiality, protein functionality, chromatin, spacer efficacy

Generative (design)
- (Soon) `/api/design/*` — guide RNA, repair template, codon optimization

Orchestrator
- (Soon) `/api/command/*` — evidence & design bundles with snapshots

## Co‑Pilot Answer Shapes

- Minimal Answer (summary + actions)
```json
{
  "summary": "BRAF V600E has moderate LoB; limited sequence disruption but strong prior.",
  "evidence": {"tier": "consider", "citations": ["PMID:37059834"], "clinvar": {"classification": "pathogenic"}},
  "links": {"clinvar": "https://...", "ensembl": "https://..."},
  "actions": [
    {"label": "Deeper analysis", "endpoint": "/api/evidence/deep_analysis", "payload": {...}},
    {"label": "Run profiles", "endpoint": "/api/evo/score_variant_profile", "payload": {...}}
  ],
  "provenance": {"operational_mode": "research", "feature_flags": {"enable_massive_modes": false}}
}
```

- Literature Answer (with Diffbot)
```json
{
  "query": "BRAF V600E multiple myeloma response to BRAF inhibitors",
  "results": [{"pmid": "37059834", "title": "Dabrafenib + trametinib...", "url": "https://pubmed..."}],
  "extractions": [{"url": "https://journal...", "title": "...", "snippet": "..."}],
  "synthesis": "Trials suggest benefit in V600E‑mutated MM; evidence still limited.",
  "badges": ["RCT"],
  "provenance": {"cached": true}
}
```

## Query Templates (seed suggestions)

- Variant impact: "What is the functional impact of {gene} {hgvs_p} in {disease}?"
- Drug efficacy: "Is {drug} likely to benefit patients with {gene} {hgvs_p} in {disease}?"
- Evidence gap fill: "Find RCTs/guidelines for {drug} in {disease} with {gene} variants."
- Design prompt: "Design 3 gRNAs near {chrom}:{pos} with PAM=NGG."

## Diffbot & Deep Navigation

- Prefer backend `/api/evidence/extract` to call Diffbot with retries and secrets handled server‑side.
- After extraction, the Co‑Pilot should:
  - Store a short note + link in its answer, not the full text.
  - Offer “Summarize this paper” which calls `/api/evidence/explain` with relevant context (gene, hgvs_p, evo2_result, clinvar, top_results).
  - For deeper pages (supplement, figures), trigger another `/api/evidence/extract` with the found links.

## Caching, Backoff, and Limits

- Obey backend caching windows; never hammer PubMed/Diffbot directly from the browser.
- Use exponential backoff on retries (the backend already implements it; prefer calling backend).
- Respect `max_results`, `time_window` to keep responses snappy.

## Guardrails

- Never present massive/synthetic scores as clinical.
- When calibration is `fallback`, label confidence accordingly (e.g., "percentile based on fallback").
- If endpoints are disabled by flags, offer alternative suggestions (e.g., literature first).

## Iteration Roadmap for the Co‑Pilot

1) Intent Router: implement a lightweight classifier that maps questions to the API Matrix and builds payloads from page context (page, variant, disease).
2) Evidence Badges: render RCT/Guideline/ClinVar‑Strong on answers; show citation counts and titles.
3) Actions as First‑Class: always include 1‑click actions to run profiles/probes/deep analysis or bundles.
4) Logging: attach `run_signature` when the backend returns it; send a `copilot_interaction` event to Supabase.
5) Confidence Language: display tier and rationale sentences aligned to S/P/E (“Seq weak, Path aligned via RAS, strong ClinVar prior”).
6) Personalization (later): remember user’s last variant/page to seed next suggestions; surface deltas since last run.

## Success Criteria

- Answers consistently cite backend evidence; tiers/confidence match backend outputs.
- Users can launch deeper analysis and design from the Co‑Pilot in one click.
- Evidence coverage improves over time (more citations saved, fewer fallback calibrations) without extra user effort.

## Knowledge Base (KB) — Canonical Spec (align to S/P/E)

Target: Replace ad‑hoc JSON KB with a structured, variant‑aware store that directly feeds evidence badges and LoB explanations. Keep disk JSON during prototyping, but design for Supabase later.

Required fields per paper (extend `KnowledgeBase.add_paper`):
- identity: `pmid`, `doi?`, `url`, `year`, `journal`
- variant indexing: `gene`, `hgvs_p?`, `disease`, `variant_info` (already present)
- study metadata: `study_type` (rct|meta|guideline|cohort|case|preclinical), `trial_phase?`, `n?`
- evidence mapping: `drug_mentions[]`, `effect_direction` (benefit|resistance|neutral|unknown), `evidence_tags[]` (e.g., RCT, Guideline, ClinVar‑Strong), `lob_implication` (+/0/−)
- embeddings: `embedding` or provider‑specific keys (already present), `combined_score` (computed at retrieval)
- ingestion provenance: `added_to_kb`, `source` (pubmed|diffbot), `extracted_sections[]`

KB lifecycle:
- On add: run `ClinicalInsightsProcessor` → fill study_type, drug_mentions, effect_direction; compute embeddings.
- On search: return top‑K with `similarity_score` and `combined_score`.
- On export/import: persist the above; do not persist raw full text.
- On refresh: version embeddings and keep `embedding_provider` in metadata.

KB alignment hooks (to implement):
- Normalize disease terms (e.g., map “myelomatosis” → “multiple myeloma”).
- Normalize drugs to canonical names/classes (e.g., “dabrafenib” → class `BRAF inhibitor`).
- Attach `clinvar_link` when gene/hgvs_p present.

## Query Builder — Evidence‑First Templates

Current file: `core/query_builder.py` (uses LLM to produce PubMed query). Improve with explicit templates:
- Variant efficacy (drug):
  `(("{gene}"[tiab] OR "{gene} mutation"[tiab]) AND ("{hgvs_p}"[tiab] OR "V600E"[tiab] OR mutation[tiab])) AND ("{disease}"[mh] OR "{disease}"[tiab]) AND (randomized controlled trial[pt] OR clinical trial[pt] OR guideline[pt]) AND english[lang]`
- Mechanism/function:
  `("{gene}"[tiab] AND ("{hgvs_p}"[tiab] OR mutation[tiab]) AND (function[tiab] OR mechanism[tiab])) AND english[lang]`
- Resistance patterns:
  `("{drug}"[tiab] AND (resistance[tiab] OR refractory[tiab]) AND ("{disease}"[mh] OR "{disease}"[tiab]))`

Additions to builder:
- Always include disease MeSH (e.g., `multiple myeloma[mh]`) and synonyms.
- Inject inferred filters into response `{inferred_filters:{study_type:["rct","guideline"], years:"2015-3000"}}`.

## RAG Pipeline — Boosts, Rerank, Diffbot

Files: `rag_query_processor.py`, `knowledge_base.py`, `llm_rerank.py`.

Retrieval improvements:
- Boost papers by study_type weight (RCT: +0.3, guideline: +0.25, cohort: +0.1) and recentness (≥2020: +0.1) in `_calculate_variant_relevance_boost`.
- Add optional reranker `llm_rerank.py` on top‑N for higher precision.
- If abstracts too thin, call backend `/api/evidence/extract` (Diffbot) to fetch full text and then re‑embed snippets; cache extraction URLs in KB.

Answer confidence mapping:
- Map `evidence_level` to badges and provide a short “Why”: number of RCTs, guideline presence, recency.
- Return `{evidence_tier_hint}` to help the evidence owner crosswalk into S/P/E E‑field.

## Co‑Pilot ↔ Backend Usage Contract

Use backend for all external I/O:
- PubMed: call `/api/evidence/literature` with `{gene,hgvs_p,disease,max_results,time_window}`
- Diffbot: call `/api/evidence/extract` on URLs; do not call Diffbot from the browser
- ClinVar/Deep: call `/api/evidence/deep_analysis`

Return to UI:
- Always include `citations:[{pmid,title,url,badges[]}]`, `tier_hint`, and actionable `links`.
- Provide `actions[]` with endpoint + payload to launch deeper analysis or design.

---

## Gaps & Next Items

1) KB normalization & schema — implement study_type/drug mapping and evidence_tags; persist in JSON now, plan Supabase table later.
2) Query builder templates — add disease MeSH and trial/guideline filters; return `inferred_filters`.
3) Retrieval boosts — add study type/recency weighting; optional LLM rerank.
4) Diffbot loop — integrate `/api/evidence/extract` into RAG when abstracts are short.
5) Confidence harmonization — map RAG `evidence_level/confidence` → backend tiering language for consistency in Co‑Pilot answers.
