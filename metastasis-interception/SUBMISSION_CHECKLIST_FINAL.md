## 📝 EXECUTION NOTES (Add Here)

### Gap Analysis & Risks

**Date**: January 31, 2025

**Gaps Found**:
- [x] **PDF/.docx files missing**: Only 2 PDFs found (one-pager), no compiled manuscript PDF/docx
- [x] **GitHub repo not created**: README references `https://github.com/crispro-ai/Metastasis-Interception-CRISPR-EVO2-Alphafold` but repo doesn't exist yet
- [x] **Zenodo DOI placeholder**: README shows `10.5281/zenodo.XXXXXXX` - needs actual DOI
- [x] **Supplementary Info PDF missing**: Need to compile from existing markdown files
- [x] **Figure DPI verification**: Figures exist but need to verify all are 300+ DPI (not just check file sizes)
- [x] **75 CIF files vs 15 claimed**: Found 75 .cif files in structural_validation/ but manuscript claims 15 guides (likely 5 models per guide = 15 guides × 5 = 75 files - need to verify mapping)
- [x] **Duplicate publication locations**: Both `publication/` and `publications/01-metastasis-interception/` exist - need to consolidate or clarify which is source of truth
- [x] **CRITICAL: reproduce_all.sh missing**: REPRODUCIBILITY.md claims one-command reproduction but `publication/scripts/reproduce_all.sh` doesn't exist
- [x] **Scripts directory empty**: `publication/scripts/` appears empty - no reproduction scripts found

**Corner-Cutting Risks**:
- [ ] **Agent might skip DPI verification**: Just rename files without checking actual resolution
- [ ] **Agent might create placeholder GitHub repo**: Empty repo with just README, no actual code
- [ ] **Agent might skip supplementary compilation**: Claim it's done but PDF is incomplete
- [ ] **Agent might use wrong manuscript version**: Multiple manuscript files exist, might compile wrong one
- [ ] **Agent might skip structural file verification**: Just zip all .cif files without verifying they match the 15 guides claimed

**Hallucination Risks**:
- [ ] **Claims "100% ready" but PDF/docx missing**: Status says ready but compiled files don't exist
- [ ] **Claims "15 mmCIF files" but 75 found**: Need to verify which 15 are the actual validated guides
- [ ] **Claims "GitHub repo exists" but URL is placeholder**: README references repo that doesn't exist
- [ ] **Claims "all figures 300+ DPI" but not verified**: Need actual DPI check, not just file size
- [ ] **Claims "complete reproducibility" but scripts may be incomplete**: Need to verify `reproduce_all.sh` actually works

**Code Audit Findings**:
- [x] **Manuscript exists**: `COMPLETE_MANUSCRIPT_FOR_REVIEW.md` (201 lines) - verified
- [x] **Cover letter exists**: `COVER_LETTER.md` - verified
- [x] **Figures exist**: 14+ PNG/SVG files in `publication/figures/` - verified
- [x] **Structural files exist**: 75 .cif files found (need to verify which are the 15 guides)
- [x] **Data files exist**: Multiple CSV/JSON files in `publication/data/` - verified (real_target_lock_data.csv has correct structure)
- [x] **Reproducibility guide exists**: `REPRODUCIBILITY.md` - verified BUT references `reproduce_all.sh` that doesn't exist
- [x] **Submission checklist exists**: This file - verified
- [x] **Audit document exists**: `.cursor/PUBLICATION_AUDIT_COMPLETE.md` - comprehensive audit found (871 lines)
- [x] **304 vs 384 clarification**: Documented in READY_FOR_SUBMISSION_SUMMARY.md (384 total = 48 genes × 8 steps, 304 primary-only = 38 genes × 8 steps)

**Plan Iterations**:
- [ ] **Iteration 1**: Verify which 15 .cif files correspond to the 15 validated guides (75 total suggests 5 models per guide = AlphaFold 3 ensemble)
- [ ] **Iteration 2**: Create actual GitHub repo (not placeholder) with all code and data - OR decide to wait until acceptance
- [ ] **Iteration 3**: Generate Zenodo DOI before submission (not "upon acceptance") - OR clarify policy
- [ ] **Iteration 4**: Verify figure DPI programmatically (not just visual inspection) - use ImageMagick or PIL
- [ ] **Iteration 5**: CREATE `reproduce_all.sh` script - currently missing despite being claimed in REPRODUCIBILITY.md
- [ ] **Iteration 6**: Consolidate duplicate publication directories (`publication/` vs `publications/01-metastasis-interception/`) - clarify source of truth
- [ ] **Iteration 7**: Map structural validation files to manuscript claims - verify 15 guides match the 15 structures claimed

### Blockers & Decisions Needed

**Blockers**:
- [ ] **GitHub repo decision**: Create now or wait until acceptance? (Checklist says "wait until acceptance" but README references it)
- [ ] **Zenodo DOI decision**: Generate now or wait? (Some docs say "upon acceptance", others reference placeholder)
- [ ] **Manuscript compilation**: Which manuscript file is the final version? Multiple exist (`COMPLETE_MANUSCRIPT_FOR_REVIEW.md`, `MANUSCRIPT_COMPLETE_FOR_SUBMISSION.md`)
- [ ] **Structural file selection**: Which 15 of 75 .cif files are the validated guides? Need mapping

**Alpha Decisions Needed**:
- [ ] **Author order**: Fahad Kiani*, Ridwaan Jhetam or equal contributors?
- [ ] **Ridwaan's email**: For submission metadata
- [ ] **Country/affiliation**: For submission portal
- [ ] **Suggested reviewers**: Use recommended list or Alpha provides?
- [ ] **GitHub repo timing**: Create public repo now or wait?
- [ ] **Zenodo DOI timing**: Generate now or wait?
- [ ] **Journal selection**: Nature Biotechnology confirmed or consider alternatives?
