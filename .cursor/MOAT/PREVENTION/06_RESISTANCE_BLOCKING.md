# 06 — Resistance-Blocking Drugs (Direct Countermeasure)

**Purpose:** Define how we present “block the resistance mechanism” (e.g., RAD51 inhibitors) as trial-first or Tier-2.

---

## When This Applies

- DDR_bin suggests HR restoration
- A specific mechanism is suspected/confirmed (e.g., RAD51C reversion)

---

## Outputs

- Trial-first recommendation:
  - “Search trials for RAD51 / HR restoration blockers”
- Evidence tier: typically **C** unless strong human evidence exists
- Safety notes: “experimental / RUO / eligibility required”

---

## What We Need From Manager

- Which targets count as “resistance blockers” for OV DDR escape?
- Which drugs/trials are canonical examples?
