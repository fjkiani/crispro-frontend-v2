## 🎯 WHY THIS TRIAL IS A GOOD FIT FOR AYESHA (LLM Analysis)

### **Clinical Trial Analysis: NCT01000259 for AK**

This is an observational, non-interventional tissue procurement study, not a treatment trial. It is designed to analyze archived tumor samples from patients treated on specific historical trials. Therefore, it is not a therapeutic option for Ayesha.

**1. Drug Mechanism Fit**
- This trial does not involve a drug or a therapeutic mechanism. It is a correlative study analyzing tumor-infiltrating T cells in archived tissue samples from past GOG (Gynecologic Oncology Group) trials.
- It offers no direct treatment for Ayesha's Stage IVB HGSOC, peritoneal carcinomatosis, or pleural effusions. Its purpose is purely for research to identify potential prognostic biomarkers.

**2. Location Logistics**
- No NYC-based sites are listed for this trial.
- As this is a non-therapeutic trial requiring enrollment in long-closed legacy studies, location is not a relevant factor for this patient.

**3. Risk-Benefit for Ayesha**
- **Risk:** There is no direct clinical risk to Ayesha. The trial analyzes tissue that would have already been collected during her primary surgery. It does not involve any additional procedures, interventions, or medications.
- **Benefit:** There is no direct clinical benefit to Ayesha. The potential benefit is indirect and altruistic: contributing tissue to research that may help future patients by improving prognostic understanding.
- Her clinical status (pulmonary compromise, tumor burden, ECOG 1) is irrelevant to the risk-benefit assessment of this specific non-interventional study.

**4. Comparison to Standard of Care (SOC)**
- This trial cannot be compared to her planned SOC (Carboplatin + Paclitaxel + Bevacizumab). It is not an alternative treatment.
- Her planned regimen is an established, evidence-based frontline therapy for advanced ovarian cancer. This trial is an ancillary research study that studies patients who have received a similar SOC in the past. It offers no therapy.

**5. Critical Considerations**
- **Primary Disqualifier:** The most critical point is that Ayesha is **categorically ineligible**. The inclusion criteria require prior enrollment on specific, historical GOG trials (e.g., GOG-0114, GOG-0132, GOG-0158) that closed to accrual many years ago. As a newly diagnosed patient, she cannot meet this fundamental requirement.
- **Trial Purpose:** It is essential to understand this is a retrospective correlative study, not a prospective clinical trial offering a novel treatment. The goal is to learn from past patients, not to treat current ones.

**Conclusion:** This trial is **not a suitable or available option** for Ayesha. Her focus should remain on her planned standard-of-care therapy. If she is interested in clinical trials, she should seek actively enrolling, first-line *interventional* trials for advanced HGSOC.

💡 STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS

### Best-Case Scenario:
✅ Ayesha enrolls in NCT01000259
✅ Access to experimental therapy
✅ Close monitoring, expert care
**Probability**: ~50%

### Most Likely Scenario:
Ayesha completes screening and enrolls successfully

### Challenge Scenario:
Screen failure due to other eligibility criteria (performance status, organ function, etc.)

## 📋 FULL ELIGIBILITY TEXT

### Eligibility Criteria
Inclusion Criteria:

* Diagnosis of stage III or IV ovarian epithelial cancer and enrolled on Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG)-0136 and a GOG front-line platinum/taxol chemotherapy trial (GOG-0114, GOG-132, GOG-0158, or GOG-0162)
* Must have fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue from primary surgery available from 1 of the following sources:

  * Patients enrolled on GOG-0136 and a GOG front-line platinum/taxol chemotherapy trial(GOG-0114, GOG-0132, GOG-0158, and GOG-0162)
  * Patients who have had either optimal or suboptimal cytoreductive surgery
  * Patients for whom adequate demographic data, including major prognostic factors and follow-up information, were collected
* Evaluable patients must have had measurable or nonmeasurable disease
* Demographic and follow-up data available

## 📊 TRIAL DESCRIPTION

This research study is looking at tumor tissue samples from patients who have undergone surgery for advanced stage III or stage IV ovarian epithelial cancer. Studying samples of tumor tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn how tumor infiltrating T cells can predict how patients will respond to treatment.

## 🏥 LOCATION DETAILS

### USA Locations (Priority for Ayesha)

1. **Gynecologic Oncology Group** - Philadelphia, Pennsylvania

## ⚠️ CRITICAL GATES FOR AYESHA

✅ No critical biomarker gates identified. Proceed with standard eligibility screening.

## ⚔️ TACTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS

**Priority**: 🔥 **P0 - IMMEDIATE ACTION** (Eligibility: ~50%)

**Next Steps**:
1. **Order biomarker tests** (HER2 IHC, HRD if not done)
2. **Contact trial site** (within 48 hours)
3. **Pre-screen Ayesha** (get on coordinator's radar)
4. **Decision at Week 2**: Enroll if eligible
5. **Prepare medical records** (surgical report, pathology, CA-125 history)

**Expected Timeline**:
- Week 1: Complete L1 chemo (cycle 6)
- Week 2: Biomarker results available
- Week 3: Enroll in trial (if eligible) or proceed with SOC maintenance


---

## 🎯 VALUE PROPOSITION

**WIN-WIN SCENARIO**:
- If eligible (50% chance) → Access to experimental therapy
- If not eligible → Gets proven SOC (PARP or bevacizumab maintenance)
- Either way, Ayesha receives appropriate care

**Risk-Benefit**: Low risk (pre-screening doesn't commit to enrollment), high reward (cutting-edge therapy)
