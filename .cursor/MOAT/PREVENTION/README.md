# 🎯 PREVENTION: From Detection → Intervention → Chronic Disease

**Owner:** Zo (strategy) + Plumber (implementation)  
**Status:** ✅ **Framework written** → ⏳ **Now needs Manager decisions + build**  
**Location:** `.cursor/MOAT/PREVENTION/`

## The Core Thesis

- **Stage 2 (Predictive)**: We can detect resistance early (DDR_bin trend) while resistant clones are still minority.
- **Stage 3 (Preventive)**: We intervene *before* resistant clones become dominant.
- **Stage 4 (Endgame)**: Cancer becomes chronic disease via cycling/steering.

## ✅ Start Here (Source of Truth)

- `idea.mdc` — manager guidance (raw)
- `01_THE_VISION.md` — 4-phase evolution
- `02_FIVE_INTERVENTION_STRATEGIES.md` — the playbook
- `08_INFRASTRUCTURE_REQUIREMENTS.md` — what to build
- `10_AYESHA_TREATMENT_PLAN.md` — end-to-end example

---

## 🧭 Execution Packet (What Manager + Plumber Need)

- `MANAGER_DECISIONS_REQUIRED.md` — **lock thresholds, claims, guardrails, MVP shape**
- `PLUMBER_BUILD_SPEC.md` — **data contracts, endpoints, fixtures, acceptance tests**
- `HARD_QUESTIONS.md` — full inventory of unknowns
- `PLUMBER_INVESTIGATION_TASKS.md` — experiments to turn unknowns into numbers

## 📚 Strategy Deep Dives (Optional Reading)

- `03_ADAPTIVE_THERAPY.md`
- `04_COMBINATION_THERAPY.md`
- `05_MECHANISM_TARGETED.md`
- `06_RESISTANCE_BLOCKING.md`
- `07_EVOLUTIONARY_STEERING.md`

## 🧪 Clinical Validation

- `09_CLINICAL_TRIAL_DESIGN.md` — DDR_bin-guided umbrella trial sketch

---

## What’s Next (2-step)

1. **Manager fills** `MANAGER_DECISIONS_REQUIRED.md`
2. Plumber implements `PLUMBER_BUILD_SPEC.md` and creates `validate_prevention_mvp.py`
