## 🎯 WHY THIS TRIAL IS A GOOD FIT FOR AYESHA (LLM Analysis)

### **Clinical Trial Analysis: NCT03860272**

**Note**: This is a structured fallback analysis (LLM unavailable).

#### **1. Drug Mechanism Fit**
The trial "Fc-Engineered Anti-CTLA-4 Monoclonal Antibody in Advanced Cancer" requires detailed mechanism analysis. Review the trial protocol to understand how the investigational drug addresses Ayesha's Stage IVB High-Grade Serous Ovarian Carcinoma with extensive tumor burden and pleural metastases.

#### **2. Location Logistics**
Review trial locations to identify NYC metro sites accessible from ZIP 10029 (East Harlem). Preferred centers: Mount Sinai (local), MSK (2 miles), NYU Langone (3-4 miles).

#### **3. Risk-Benefit for Ayesha**
**Key Considerations**:
- Pulmonary compromise: Large bilateral pleural effusions require careful monitoring
- ECOG 1: Acceptable for most trials, but toxicity profile is critical
- Tumor burden: Extensive disease (CA-125 >2800) may require aggressive initial treatment

#### **4. Comparison to Standard of Care**
Ayesha's planned SOC is Carboplatin + Paclitaxel + Bevacizumab (NCCN-guideline first-line therapy for Stage IVB HGSOC, BRCA wildtype). This trial should be compared to this regimen to assess:
- Is it a replacement for SOC (frontline trial)?
- Is it additional to SOC (maintenance trial)?
- Is it an alternative if SOC fails?

#### **5. Critical Considerations**
1. **Biomarker testing**: HER2 and HRD status are unknown - may be required for enrollment
2. **Timing**: When should Ayesha enroll? Before SOC, during SOC, or after response?
3. **Clinical team review**: Discuss with Ayesha's oncologist before enrollment decisions

**Recommendation**: Full protocol review with clinical team required.

7. Female participants of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening (within 72 hours of first dose of study medication). Non-childbearing potential is defined as 1 of the following:

   1. ≥ 45 years of age and has not had menses for \> 1 year and there is no alternative medical cause.
   2. Amenorrheic for \> 2 years without a hysterectomy and/or oophorectomy and follicle stimulating hormone value in the postmenopausal range upon pretrial (screening) evaluation.
   3. Status is post-hysterectomy, -oophorectomy, or -tubal ligation.
8. Female participants of childbearing potential must be willing to use highly effective contraceptive measures starting with the Screening visit through 90 days after last dose of study treatment. For the UK only, highly effective contraceptive measures are defined as follows:

   1. Combined (estrogen and progesterone containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation.

      * Oral
      * Intravaginal

9. Male participants with a female partner(s) of childbearing potential must agree to use highly effective contraceptive measures throughout the trial starting with the Screening visit through 90 days after the last dose of study treatment is received. Males with pregnant partners must agree to use a condom (which is not considered "highly effective"); no additional method of contraception is required for the pregnant partner. Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the established and preferred contraception method for the participant.

   The following inclusion criteria are in addition to the above criteria. If there are criteria below that differs from above, the below indication-specific criteria take precedence.

13. Child-Pugh score of A. Note: Participants on anticoagulant treatment would have an assigned value of 1 point when scoring prothrombin time/international normalized ratio so the overall Child-Pugh score is not adversely affected.
14. Adequate organ and bone marrow reserve function as indicated by the following laboratory values:

    1. Platelet count ≥ 60 × 10\^6/cubic millimeter (mm\^3) and absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,000 × 10\^6/L are acceptable provided that the investigator assesses these abnormalities as being due to liver disease.

## 📊 TRIAL DESCRIPTION

This study is an open-label, Phase 1, multicenter study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamic (PD) profiles of a novel fragment crystallizable (Fc)-engineered immunoglobulin G1 anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (anti-CTLA-4) human monoclonal antibody (botensilimab) monotherapy and in combination with an anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) antibody (balstilimab), and to assess the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in participants with advanced solid tumors. This study will also determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of botensilimab monotherapy and in combination with balstilimab.
