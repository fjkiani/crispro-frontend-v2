      "title": "Custom Gene Panel Analysis Identifies Novel Polymorphisms Associated with Clopidogrel Response in Patients Undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Intervention with Stent.",
      "abstract": "Clopidogrel is widely used as an antiplatelet therapy for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Genetic factors influence variability in clopidogrel response, with non-functional CYP2C19 alleles increasing the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs). While CYP2C19 genotype-guided therapy after PCI improves outcomes, MACEs persist at variable rates. Pharmacogenomics (PGx) has primarily focused on genes related to drug metabolism, but therapeutic failure may stem from individual disease predisposition. This study aims to identify novel genetic variants underlying adverse events after PCI despite PGx-guided therapy. A custom sequencing panel was analyzed in 244 ACS-PCI-stent patients and 99 controls without cardiovascular (CV) disease. Association analysis was performed independent of treatment and by prescribed treatment (clopidogrel or prasugrel), complemented by random forest models to predict risk during antiplatelet therapy. No polymorphism reached genomic significance, but in clopidogrel-treated patients, rs2472434 in ABCA1 , related to altered lipid metabolism, was strongly associated with secondary CV events ( p = 1.7 &#xd7; 10 -3 ). Variants in the clopidogrel pathway, including CYP2C19 , ABCB1 , and UGT2B7 , were also identified and may influence clopidogrel response. Predictive models incorporating these variants effectively discriminated patients with and without events ( p = 0.02445). Our findings support combined genotyping of CYP2C19 loss-of-function and ABCB1 C3435T variants to guide antiplatelet therapy and suggest additional targets, such as rs2472434 ( ABCA1 ) and rs7439366 ( UGT2B7 ), to improve risk prediction of adverse CV events. Therefore, the unexplained variability in clopidogrel response may be due to disease pathogenesis itself, highlighting the need for a paradigm shift in PGx studies.",

      "abstract": "CYP2C19 polymorphisms influence clopidogrel metabolism, which may influence long-term stroke prognosis. The authors sought to investigate whether CYP2C19 polymorphisms were associated with long-term recurrent ischemic events in patients with acute ischemic stroke due to large-artery atherosclerosis (LAA). The present study, comprising a sub-data set from the National Cerebral and Cardiovascular Center Genome Registry-a data registry from a multicenter, prospective, observational study-enrolled patients with LAA stroke within 7 days of stroke onset who consented to genotyping of CYP2C19 polymorphism between 2004 and 2022. Based on CYP2C19 polymorphisms, participants were assigned to 1 of 3 groups: extensive metabolizers (&#x2217;1/&#x2217;1), intermediate metabolizers (&#x2217;1/&#x2217;2, &#x2217;1/&#x2217;3), and poor metabolizers (&#x2217;2/&#x2217;2, &#x2217;2/&#x2217;3, &#x2217;3/&#x2217;3). The primary endpoint was the recurrence of symptomatic ischemic stroke/transient ischemic attack. Among 369 participants with LAA stroke (96 females [26.0%]; age, median [Q1-Q3], 74 [65-80] years) and a median follow-up of 5.1 years, poor or intermediate metabolizers (PM/IMs) (n = 164) had a significantly higher risk of recurrent symptomatic ischemic stroke transient ischemic attack than extensive metabolizers (n = 205) (adjusted HR: 2.33; 95% CI: 1.28-4.24). Furthermore, restricting the analysis to patients taking clopidogrel, PM/IMs exhibited a similarly significant risk (adjusted HR: 5.26; 95% CI: 1.87-14.56). In patients with LAA stroke, CYP2C19 PM/IMs had a significantly higher long-term recurrence rate of ischemic events than extensive metabolizers. Copyright &#xa9; 2025 The Authors.

      "abstract": "The CYP2C19 gene encodes one of the main enzymes responsible for clopidogrel bioactivation, a widely prescribed antiplatelet prodrug. Due to its high polymorphism, clopidogrel response varies considerably, especially in carriers of nonfunctional alleles, such as CYP2C192 and &#x2009;*&#x2009;3 . Meta-analyses have associated CYP2C19 loss-of-function alleles with worse cardiovascular outcomes, and genotype-guided strategies have demonstrated feasibility and clinical utility, supporting the rationale for locally validated implementation in Brazil. Personalized treatment strategies, based on preemptive genotyping and genotype-guided recommendations, have been proposed to improve clopidogrel efficacy and safety. However, extrapolating international guidelines to genetically diverse and underrepresented populations, such as Brazilians, poses challenges. Therefore, to discuss the clinical application of this testing in Brazil, it is also necessary to explore strategies that promote national pharmacogenomic studies, enhance infrastructure and training, and better align public policies. This study followed a contextual synthesis approach, with evidence identified through PubMed (last updated July 2025), and discusses structural and scientific barriers to implementing precision medicine in a local context of Brazil, proposing strategies for CYP2C19 -clopidogrel pharmacogenetics at the Hospital de Cl&#xed;nicas of the Universidade Federal do Tri&#xe2;ngulo Mineiro (HC-UFTM), Minas Gerais, Brazil, considering both local realities and broader systemic limitations.",

      "title": "Association of Clopidogrel Genetic Polymorphism With Efficacy and Safety for Ischemic Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack: A Systematic Review and Updated Meta-Analysis.",
      "abstract": "Research suggests that CYP2C19 loss-of-function (LoF) alleles impede the metabolism of clopidogrel. However, there is limited research on the relationship between these alleles and the risk of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) recurrence in patients taking clopidogrel. This updated meta-analysis aims to evaluate the relationship between CYP2C19 LoF alleles and the risk of stroke or TIA recurrence among patients receiving clopidogrel. Relevant literature was obtained from searches of PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Central Register Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and Embase. The outcome measures of included studies were stroke or TIA, composite vascular events as an efficacy, and bleeding as a safety outcome. This meta-analysis was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (PROSPERO ID: CRD42024564771). An analysis of 28 studies encompassing 11,401 patients treated with clopidogrel following stroke or TIA revealed that carriers of CYP2C19 LoF alleles had significantly higher risk of stroke recurrence compared to non-carriers (risk ratio [RR], 1.89; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.55-2.32). Composite vascular events were also significantly more frequent in carriers of the CYP2C19 LoF allele than in non-carriers (RR, 1.54; 95% CI: 1.16-2.04). Both observational studies (RR, 2.20; 95% CI: 1.74-2.79) and post-hoc analyses of randomized controlled trials (RR, 1.44; 95% CI: 1.04-1.99) demonstrated significantly increased recurrence risk among carriers of these alleles. This risk was especially pronounced in Asian populations (RR, 1.97; 95% CI: 1.60-2.43). There was insufficient data specific to other ethnic groups for definite conclusions. The incidence of bleeding events was similar between groups. Carriers of CYP2C19 LoF alleles treated with clopidogrel had a higher risk of stroke or TIA recurrence than non-carriers. This risk was higher in Asian populations. Copyright &#xa9; 2025 Korean Neurological Association.",

      "abstract": "Clopidogrel resistance/high on-treatment platelet reactivity (HTPR) has been associated with interindividual variability in the clopidogrel treatment response in different ethnicities leading to adverse coronary events. The current study evaluated the effect of genetics and clinical factors on platelet inhibition in clopidogrel-treated South Indian CAD patients. We genotyped 15 genetic polymorphisms in the genes associated with the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of clopidogrel. We observed a high prevalence of the poor metabolizer CYP2C19*2 (34%) variant and CYP2C19-based high-risk metabolizer phenotype such intermediate and poor metabolizer (IM&#x2009;+&#x2009;PM) with 68.5% in CAD patients. The platelet function test revealed that 31% of the CAD cases were HTPR phenotypes (VASP PRI&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;50%). The CYP2C19*2 [OR 2.37 (95% CI 1.16-4.84), p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02], high risk CYP2C19 metabolizer phenotypes [OR 1.72 (95% CI 1.08-2.77), p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02] showed increased risk of HTPR.

      "abstract": "The selection of P2Y12 inhibitors for acute coronary syndrome patients after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) remains controversial among East Asian patients. This study aimed to identify the optimal P2Y12 inhibitor selection for the East Asian population carrying CYP2C19 loss-of-function (LOF) alleles based on the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) score. Between March 2016 and March 2019, a cohort of 8683 patients diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome who survived PCI were enrolled in this study. All patients carried the LOF allele and could calculate GRACE scores. The primary outcome was ischemic events (cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and ischemic stroke) within 12 months. Secondary outcomes included the components of the primary outcome, all-cause mortality, Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) types 2, 3, and 5 bleeding events, and BARC types 3 and 5 bleeding events. The propensity score matching method was used to balance the baseline characteristics of patients. The Kaplan-Meier/log-rank test was adopted for the result analysis, and Cox regression was employed for adjusting for confounding factors. The low-risk group comprised 5496 patients (63.3%), while the intermediate- to high-risk group included 3187 patients (36.7%) in the study population stratified by GRACE scores. The follow-up results revealed that in patients at low risk, clopidogrel and ticagrelor had comparable effects in preventing ischemic events. However, ticagrelor use was associated with a higher risk of BARC types 2, 3, and 5 bleeding events (hazard ratio [HR], 2.08; 95% CI, 1.43-3.02; P &lt; .001) and BARC types 3 and 5 bleeding events (HR, 2.69; 95% CI, 1.57-4.63; P &lt; .001) compared with clopidogrel use. In patients at intermediate to high risk, ticagrelor treatment was associated with a lower risk of stroke (HR, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.04-0.82; P = .026), while the risk of ischemic events or bleeding was comparable between the 2 treatment groups. These real-world data on East Asian patients with CYP2C19 LOF alleles suggest that GRACE risk stratification may help differentiate ischemic and bleeding risks post-PCI. &#xa9; 2025 The Authors.",

The primary outcome was 1-year MACE, defined as the composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction (MI), ischemic stroke, or stent thrombosis. Data on clinically significant bleeding and CYP2C19 genotyping alleles were collected. The PD and PCI cohorts included 728 (32.1% Black) and 2,770 (20.5% Black) participants, respectively. Black participants had higher PRU levels (184 [IQR 128-234] vs. 144 [IQR 88-195]; P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) and higher prevalence of HPR (39.3% vs. 20.6%; P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001).

      "abstract": "This paper systematically reviews recent advances in clopidogrel clinical applications to optimize therapeutic precision and medication safety. Using a literature review methodology, we elucidate clopidogrel's pharmacokinetic properties and pharmacodynamic mechanisms, while evaluating its clinical efficacy and adverse reactions in disease management. Recent studies have emphasized the key role of genetic polymorphisms in regulating the efficacy and safety of clopidogrel. Polymorphisms in the CYP2C19 gene have a significant effect on the metabolism of clopidogrel, with loss-of-function (LOF) alleles ( *2, *3 ) reducing the production of active metabolites, leading to elevated platelet reactivity and increasing the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), particularly in the Asian populations, where the prevalence of LoF alleles is as high as 29-35%. In contrast, the gain-of-function allele CYP2C19*17 results in a reduced risk of cardiovascular events but increases the risk of bleeding. This article summarizes the latest research progress and monitoring methods of clopidogrel, and suggests that clinics should combine genotyping and platelet function testing with monitoring of blood levels to optimize treatment and provide data reference for clinical administration of clopidogrel. &#xa9; 2025 Dou et al.",

      "abstract": "Polymorphism in CYP2C19 is more prevalent in East Asia than in other regions of the world. However, no systematic review has analysed CYP2C19 variation in the Southeast Asian population. The understanding of variation may serve as a foundation for pharmacogenetic research and testing in this domain. Therefore, this meta-analysis aims to clarify the variability of CYP2C19 in Southeast Asia and its clinical implications for several medications, including clopidogrel, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), and voriconazole. This systematic review employed the keywords \" CYP2C19 \" and \"Southeast Asia country,\" obtained from PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. Single proportion meta-analyses of allele distribution were performed utilizing inverse variance analysis. Meta-analyses of clinical outcomes were performed using the Mantel-Haenszel method. Based on 72 found studies, this meta-analysis revealed that CYP2C19 allele distribution in Southeast Asians is predominantly similar to that in East Asians, except for Indian Singaporeans and Malaysians, who match South and Middle Asians, and Papuans, who are similar to the Oceania population. CYP2C19 variation in Southeast Asian populations correlates with different treatment responses to clopidogrel and PPIs. The incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), hypoaggregation, and clopidogrel resistance increased among clopidogrel users with CYP2C19 intermediate and poor metabolizer phenotypes. The effectiveness of PPIs treatment for Helicobacter pylori also tends to decrease in normal and intermediate metabolizers compared to poor metabolizers. Additional high-quality studies, including RCTs of pharmacogenetic testing, are essential to encourage CYP2C19 testing in Southeast Asia. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=593116, CRD42024593116.

Only in patients without ICAS without previous antiplatelet therapy, ticagrelor-aspirin therapy reduced the risk of stroke recurrence compared with clopidogrel-aspirin therapy (adjusted hazard ratio 0.47, 95% confidence interval 0.34-0.66, P&lt;0.001). Similar effects were observed for the outcomes of composite vascular events and ischemic stroke at 3 months and 1 year. No significant differences in severe or moderate bleeding were observed between the groups. In patients with minor stroke or high-risk transient ischemic attack carrying CYP2C19 loss-of-function alleles, those without ICAS and no history of previous antiplatelet therapy may have a better response to ticagrelor-aspirin therapy for reducing new stroke and composite vascular events.",

      "abstract": "Clopidogrel is widely used as an antiplatelet therapy for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Genetic factors influence variability in clopidogrel response, with non-functional CYP2C19 alleles increasing the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs). While CYP2C19 genotype-guided therapy after PCI improves outcomes, MACEs persist at variable rates. Pharmacogenomics (PGx) has primarily focused on genes related to drug metabolism, but therapeutic failure may stem from individual disease predisposition. This study aims to identify novel genetic variants underlying adverse events after PCI despite PGx-guided therapy. A custom sequencing panel was analyzed in 244 ACS-PCI-stent patients and 99 controls without cardiovascular (CV) disease. Association analysis was performed independent of treatment and by prescribed treatment (clopidogrel or prasugrel), complemented by random forest models to predict risk during antiplatelet therapy. No polymorphism reached genomic significance, but in clopidogrel-treated patients, rs2472434 in ABCA1 , related to altered lipid metabolism, was strongly associated with secondary CV events ( p = 1.7 &#xd7; 10 -3 ). Variants in the clopidogrel pathway, including CYP2C19 , ABCB1 , and UGT2B7 , were also identified and may influence clopidogrel response. Predictive models incorporating these variants effectively discriminated patients with and without events ( p = 0.02445). Our findings support combined genotyping of CYP2C19 loss-of-function and ABCB1 C3435T variants to guide antiplatelet therapy and suggest additional targets, such as rs2472434 ( ABCA1 ) and rs7439366 ( UGT2B7 ), to improve risk prediction of adverse CV events. Therefore, the unexplained variability in clopidogrel response may be due to disease pathogenesis itself, highlighting the need for a paradigm shift in PGx studies.",

      "abstract": "CYP2C19 polymorphisms influence clopidogrel metabolism, which may influence long-term stroke prognosis. The authors sought to investigate whether CYP2C19 polymorphisms were associated with long-term recurrent ischemic events in patients with acute ischemic stroke due to large-artery atherosclerosis (LAA). The present study, comprising a sub-data set from the National Cerebral and Cardiovascular Center Genome Registry-a data registry from a multicenter, prospective, observational study-enrolled patients with LAA stroke within 7 days of stroke onset who consented to genotyping of CYP2C19 polymorphism between 2004 and 2022. Based on CYP2C19 polymorphisms, participants were assigned to 1 of 3 groups: extensive metabolizers (&#x2217;1/&#x2217;1), intermediate metabolizers (&#x2217;1/&#x2217;2, &#x2217;1/&#x2217;3), and poor metabolizers (&#x2217;2/&#x2217;2, &#x2217;2/&#x2217;3, &#x2217;3/&#x2217;3). The primary endpoint was the recurrence of symptomatic ischemic stroke/transient ischemic attack. Among 369 participants with LAA stroke (96 females [26.0%]; age, median [Q1-Q3], 74 [65-80] years) and a median follow-up of 5.1 years, poor or intermediate metabolizers (PM/IMs) (n = 164) had a significantly higher risk of recurrent symptomatic ischemic stroke transient ischemic attack than extensive metabolizers (n = 205) (adjusted HR: 2.33; 95% CI: 1.28-4.24). Furthermore, restricting the analysis to patients taking clopidogrel, PM/IMs exhibited a similarly significant risk (adjusted HR: 5.26; 95% CI: 1.87-14.56). In patients with LAA stroke, CYP2C19 PM/IMs had a significantly higher long-term recurrence rate of ischemic events than extensive metabolizers. Copyright &#xa9; 2025 The Authors.

      "abstract": "The CYP2C19 gene encodes one of the main enzymes responsible for clopidogrel bioactivation, a widely prescribed antiplatelet prodrug. Due to its high polymorphism, clopidogrel response varies considerably, especially in carriers of nonfunctional alleles, such as CYP2C192 and &#x2009;*&#x2009;3 . Meta-analyses have associated CYP2C19 loss-of-function alleles with worse cardiovascular outcomes, and genotype-guided strategies have demonstrated feasibility and clinical utility, supporting the rationale for locally validated implementation in Brazil. Personalized treatment strategies, based on preemptive genotyping and genotype-guided recommendations, have been proposed to improve clopidogrel efficacy and safety. However, extrapolating international guidelines to genetically diverse and underrepresented populations, such as Brazilians, poses challenges. Therefore, to discuss the clinical application of this testing in Brazil, it is also necessary to explore strategies that promote national pharmacogenomic studies, enhance infrastructure and training, and better align public policies. This study followed a contextual synthesis approach, with evidence identified through PubMed (last updated July 2025), and discusses structural and scientific barriers to implementing precision medicine in a local context of Brazil, proposing strategies for CYP2C19 -clopidogrel pharmacogenetics at the Hospital de Cl&#xed;nicas of the Universidade Federal do Tri&#xe2;ngulo Mineiro (HC-UFTM), Minas Gerais, Brazil, considering both local realities and broader systemic limitations.",

      "abstract": "Research suggests that CYP2C19 loss-of-function (LoF) alleles impede the metabolism of clopidogrel. However, there is limited research on the relationship between these alleles and the risk of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) recurrence in patients taking clopidogrel. This updated meta-analysis aims to evaluate the relationship between CYP2C19 LoF alleles and the risk of stroke or TIA recurrence among patients receiving clopidogrel. Relevant literature was obtained from searches of PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Central Register Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and Embase. The outcome measures of included studies were stroke or TIA, composite vascular events as an efficacy, and bleeding as a safety outcome. This meta-analysis was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (PROSPERO ID: CRD42024564771). An analysis of 28 studies encompassing 11,401 patients treated with clopidogrel following stroke or TIA revealed that carriers of CYP2C19 LoF alleles had significantly higher risk of stroke recurrence compared to non-carriers (risk ratio [RR], 1.89; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.55-2.32). Composite vascular events were also significantly more frequent in carriers of the CYP2C19 LoF allele than in non-carriers (RR, 1.54; 95% CI: 1.16-2.04). Both observational studies (RR, 2.20; 95% CI: 1.74-2.79) and post-hoc analyses of randomized controlled trials (RR, 1.44; 95% CI: 1.04-1.99) demonstrated significantly increased recurrence risk among carriers of these alleles. This risk was especially pronounced in Asian populations (RR, 1.97; 95% CI: 1.60-2.43). There was insufficient data specific to other ethnic groups for definite conclusions. The incidence of bleeding events was similar between groups. Carriers of CYP2C19 LoF alleles treated with clopidogrel had a higher risk of stroke or TIA recurrence than non-carriers. This risk was higher in Asian populations. Copyright &#xa9; 2025 Korean Neurological Association.",

The current study evaluated the effect of genetics and clinical factors on platelet inhibition in clopidogrel-treated South Indian CAD patients. We genotyped 15 genetic polymorphisms in the genes associated with the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of clopidogrel. We observed a high prevalence of the poor metabolizer CYP2C19*2 (34%) variant and CYP2C19-based high-risk metabolizer phenotype such intermediate and poor metabolizer (IM&#x2009;+&#x2009;PM) with 68.5% in CAD patients.

This study aimed to identify the optimal P2Y12 inhibitor selection for the East Asian population carrying CYP2C19 loss-of-function (LOF) alleles based on the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) score. Between March 2016 and March 2019, a cohort of 8683 patients diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome who survived PCI were enrolled in this study. All patients carried the LOF allele and could calculate GRACE scores. The primary outcome was ischemic events (cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and ischemic stroke) within 12 months. Secondary outcomes included the components of the primary outcome, all-cause mortality, Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) types 2, 3, and 5 bleeding events, and BARC types 3 and 5 bleeding events. The propensity score matching method was used to balance the baseline characteristics of patients. The Kaplan-Meier/log-rank test was adopted for the result analysis, and Cox regression was employed for adjusting for confounding factors. The low-risk group comprised 5496 patients (63.3%), while the intermediate- to high-risk group included 3187 patients (36.7%) in the study population stratified by GRACE scores. The follow-up results revealed that in patients at low risk, clopidogrel and ticagrelor had comparable effects in preventing ischemic events. However, ticagrelor use was associated with a higher risk of BARC types 2, 3, and 5 bleeding events (hazard ratio [HR], 2.08; 95% CI, 1.43-3.02; P &lt; .001) and BARC types 3 and 5 bleeding events (HR, 2.69; 95% CI, 1.57-4.63; P &lt; .001) compared with clopidogrel use. In patients at intermediate to high risk, ticagrelor treatment was associated with a lower risk of stroke (HR, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.04-0.82; P = .026), while the risk of ischemic events or bleeding was comparable between the 2 treatment groups.

Using a literature review methodology, we elucidate clopidogrel's pharmacokinetic properties and pharmacodynamic mechanisms, while evaluating its clinical efficacy and adverse reactions in disease management. Recent studies have emphasized the key role of genetic polymorphisms in regulating the efficacy and safety of clopidogrel. Polymorphisms in the CYP2C19 gene have a significant effect on the metabolism of clopidogrel, with loss-of-function (LOF) alleles ( *2, *3 ) reducing the production of active metabolites, leading to elevated platelet reactivity and increasing the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), particularly in the Asian populations, where the prevalence of LoF alleles is as high as 29-35%. In contrast, the gain-of-function allele CYP2C19*17 results in a reduced risk of cardiovascular events but increases the risk of bleeding. This article summarizes the latest research progress and monitoring methods of clopidogrel, and suggests that clinics should combine genotyping and platelet function testing with monitoring of blood levels to optimize treatment and provide data reference for clinical administration of clopidogrel. &#xa9; 2025 Dou et al.",

      "abstract": "Polymorphism in CYP2C19 is more prevalent in East Asia than in other regions of the world. However, no systematic review has analysed CYP2C19 variation in the Southeast Asian population. The understanding of variation may serve as a foundation for pharmacogenetic research and testing in this domain. Therefore, this meta-analysis aims to clarify the variability of CYP2C19 in Southeast Asia and its clinical implications for several medications, including clopidogrel, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), and voriconazole. This systematic review employed the keywords \" CYP2C19 \" and \"Southeast Asia country,\" obtained from PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. Single proportion meta-analyses of allele distribution were performed utilizing inverse variance analysis. Meta-analyses of clinical outcomes were performed using the Mantel-Haenszel method. Based on 72 found studies, this meta-analysis revealed that CYP2C19 allele distribution in Southeast Asians is predominantly similar to that in East Asians, except for Indian Singaporeans and Malaysians, who match South and Middle Asians, and Papuans, who are similar to the Oceania population. CYP2C19 variation in Southeast Asian populations correlates with different treatment responses to clopidogrel and PPIs. The incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), hypoaggregation, and clopidogrel resistance increased among clopidogrel users with CYP2C19 intermediate and poor metabolizer phenotypes. The effectiveness of PPIs treatment for Helicobacter pylori also tends to decrease in normal and intermediate metabolizers compared to poor metabolizers. Additional high-quality studies, including RCTs of pharmacogenetic testing, are essential to encourage CYP2C19 testing in Southeast Asia. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=593116, CRD42024593116.

In this post-hoc analysis of the CHANCE-2 trial, patients who underwent intracranial artery imaging were included. The primary efficacy and safety outcomes were recurrent stroke and severe or moderate bleeding within 90 days. Among the 5,920 patients included, the median age was 64.8 years (interquartile range, 57.0-71.4), 2,004 (33.9%) were females, 2,385 (40.3%) had ICAS, and 701 (11.8%) had previous antiplatelet therapy before enrollment. There were significant interaction effects between previous antiplatelet therapy and dual-antiplatelet therapy regimens on the risk of recurrent stroke (P=0.003) in patients without ICAS but not in those with ICAS (P=0.557). Only in patients without ICAS without previous antiplatelet therapy, ticagrelor-aspirin therapy reduced the risk of stroke recurrence compared with clopidogrel-aspirin therapy (adjusted hazard ratio 0.47, 95% confidence interval 0.34-0.66, P&lt;0.001). Similar effects were observed for the outcomes of composite vascular events and ischemic stroke at 3 months and 1 year. No significant differences in severe or moderate bleeding were observed between the groups. In patients with minor stroke or high-risk transient ischemic attack carrying CYP2C19 loss-of-function alleles, those without ICAS and no history of previous antiplatelet therapy may have a better response to ticagrelor-aspirin therapy for reducing new stroke and composite vascular events.",

Patients with CYP2C19*2 and *3 loss of function alleles show reduced enzyme function, leading to lower active drug levels and higher risks of thromboembolic and cardiovascular events. Point-of-care CYP2C19 testing offers a personalized approach to antiplatelet therapy. We conducted a systematic review of literature assessing point-of-care CYP2C19 testing to individualize antiplatelet therapy in cardiovascular patients compared to standard therapies. The review followed PRISMA guidelines and identified 146 articles, of which 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were comprised. The three studies included 6945 patients; 3483 received genotype-guided therapy, and 3462 received standard care. Efficacy and safety outcomes were compared between groups.

This post hoc study used data from the CHANCE-2 trial. Patients with minor stroke or TIA who carried the CYP2C19 loss-of-function (LOF) allele were randomized to receive ticagrelor-aspirin (TIC-ASA) or clopidogrel-aspirin (CLO-ASA). The primary efficacy outcome was stroke recurrence within 90&#x2009;days. The primary safety outcome was severe or moderate bleeding within 90&#x2009;days. We classified patients into metabolic syndrome (MetS) and non-metabolic syndrome (non-MetS) groups. Differences in the outcome during 90-days follow-up period were assessed using the Cox proportional hazards model. Among 5652 patients, 3305 were non-MetS and 2347 were MetS. Compared with CLO-ASA, TIC-ASA significantly reduced the risk of stroke recurrence within 90&#x2009;days among patients with MetS (6.44% vs. 9.90%; HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.48-0.85; p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01); this benefit was not seen in non-MetS (6.03% vs. 5.96%; HR 1.01, 95% CI 0.77-1.34; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.93), with a significant interaction effect (p for interaction&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.03).

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of clopidogrel in patients with known CYP2C19 carrier status have provided inconsistent results. This meta-analysis aims to pool evidence on the effect of different antiplatelet strategies on outcomes according to CYP2C19 LoF status. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs to evaluate the interaction of CYP2C19 LoF allele on clopidogrel versus placebo or other antiplatelet agents in patients with cardiovascular disease or transient ischemic attack (TIA) or ischemic stroke. Primary outcomes were major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) including ischemic stroke, with major bleeding events assessed as a safety outcome. Random effects analysis estimated pooled odds ratios for LoF carriers and non-carriers. Fifteen RCTs with 35,189 participants in total were included. When all interaction effects are pooled, the occurrence of MACE was 1.29 times higher in LoF variant carriers compared to non-carriers for clopidogrel treatment (p-interaction&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.01). Risk of MACE was 1.20 times higher in LoF carriers compared to non-carriers when clopidogrel was compared to placebo (p-interaction&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.13). In TIA or minor stroke patients, the interaction effect was 1.63 times larger (p-interaction&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02). Clopidogrel was less effective than prasugrel for MACE occurrence (1.57 times higher, p-interaction&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02) and ticagrelor (1.21 times higher, p-interaction&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.19) in CYP2C19 LoF variant carriers. Bleeding outcomes were similar across groups. Clopidogrel is less effective in patients with CYP2C19 LoF genotype and cardiovascular disease, minor stroke, or TIA. The size and direction of the interaction warrant further research into the role of LoF genotypes and the cost-effectiveness of genetic testing. Prasugrel may be a more effective alternative for CYP2C19 LoF carriers.Registration-URL:https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/; Unique identifier: CRD42021242993.",

The study the potential impact and feasibility of implementing pharmacogenetics (PGx) testing to guide antiplatelet therapy and develop strategies for its clinical integration to improve patient management. A pilot study following a prospective cohort design was conducted within the largest community healthcare provider in Qatar using point-of-care (POC) CYP2C19 genotyping in tailoring antiplatelet therapy for PCI patients. Eligible patients underwent CYP2C19 genotyping, and P2Y12 inhibitor prescriptions were adjusted based on genetic results. The study measured antiplatelet prescribing patterns and identified clinically significant gene-drug interactions. Out of 376 patients tested, 283 patients received PGx-guided recommendations for anti-platelet therapy. Actionable CYP2C19 alleles were detected in 22% of those patients, prompting a change in drug therapy. PGx-guided recommendations were adopted at a rate of 80%, and CYP2C19 genotyping was a significant predictor of antiplatelet therapy adjustments. A sub-analysis of the cost impact revealed an estimated reduction of 300 QR (82.41 $) per patient annually for ACS patients who underwent PCI with stent placement. This real-world study highlights the feasibility and clinical impact of CYP2C19 genotyping in guiding antiplatelet therapy for ACS and PCI patients, supporting broader PGx testing implementation in routine cardiovascular care.

      "abstract": "Pharmacogenetic (PGx) testing for CYP2C19 genotypes offers a precision medicine approach to dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). PGx testing is limited in Thailand because of policy constraints. This study evaluated the cost-utility and budget impact of PGx-guided dual antiplatelet therapy compared with universal clopidogrel in Thailand. A hybrid decision tree and Markov model were developed to estimate lifetime costs and health outcomes for patients with post-PCI ACS from a societal perspective. The model compared universal clopidogrel with 2 PGx-guided strategies for CYP2C19 loss-of-function allele carriers. Key outcomes included life-years and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess model uncertainty. A 5-year budget impact analysis was performed from a payer perspective. Compared with universal clopidogrel, the PGx-guided ticagrelor strategy was dominant with lower costs and higher QALYs. The PGx-guided prasugrel strategy exceeded the willingness-to-pay threshold, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 247 604 Thai Baht (THB)/QALY. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses indicated a 99.9% probability that the ticagrelor strategy would be a cost-effective strategy at the Thai willingness-to-pay threshold. The 5-year budget impact analysis, assuming 100% access to PGx testing, estimated a budget saving of 240.54 million THB for ticagrelor. In contrast, prasugrel was associated with an additional requirement of 1520.89 million THB. In Thailand's healthcare setting, PGx-guided ticagrelor is a dominant strategy for patients with post-PCI ACS.

A critical barrier to effective secondary prevention is the high prevalence of CYP2C19 loss-of-function alleles, present in almost 75% of South and East Asians, which reduce clopidogrel efficacy. Evidence from trials, including CHANCE-2 (Clopidogrel in High-Risk Patients With Acute Nondisabling Cerebrovascular Events), shows that genotype-guided alternatives, including ticagrelor and cilostazol, substantially lower recurrent stroke risk in loss-of-function carriers. Yet, clinical adoption remains limited by insufficient genetic testing infrastructure, cost, guideline gaps, and clinician training. Despite these challenges, genotype-guided therapy is both feasible and cost-effective, with the potential to reduce recurrent strokes, disability, and healthcare burden. Urgent action is required to implement precision antiplatelet strategies, update guidelines, and ensure equitable access, making pharmacogenomics a central component of stroke care in Asia.",

The Cox proportional hazards model was used to further assess the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for the associations of small artery occlusion cause and VCAM-1 level with efficiency and safety outcomes. The median age of 5651 patients was 64.8&#x2009;years, 1908 of whom were women. Among all the subtypes, patients with nonelevated VCAM-1 (&lt;1715.9 ng/mL) and small artery occlusion subtype (N=1252) got more benefit from aspirin-ticagrelor therapy to reduce recurrent stroke within 90&#x2009;days (7.5% versus 2.9%, hazard ratio [HR], 0.37 [95% CI, 0.22-0.64], P &lt;0.001). Regarding safety outcomes, the risk of mild bleeding was increased in the ticagrelor-aspirin group (1.4% versus 6.7%, HR, 4.85 [95% CI, 2.36-9.96]), but no significant difference was found between the 2 groups in moderate or severe bleeding (0.6% versus 0.5%, HR, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.17-3.35]). VCAM-1 level combined with ischemic stroke cause classification subtypes might predict the effect of ticagrelor-aspirin or clopidogrel-aspirin dual antiplatelet therapy in preventing recurrent stroke within 90&#x2009;days in patients with minor ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack carrying CYP2C19 loss-of-function alleles. Patients with small artery occlusion subtype and nonelevated VCAM-1 received more clinical benefit from ticagrelor-aspirin versus clopidogrel-aspirin.

      "abstract": "To evaluate the efficacy and safety of three distinct dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) strategies following intracranial and extracranial neurovascular stenting. under the guidance of CYP2C19 genotyping. In this single-center, retrospective cohort study, consecutive patients who underwent elective neurovascular stenting in the Department of Neurology, Second Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, from January 2020 to December 2024 and completed 90-day follow-up were retrospectively enrolled. All patients received DAPT for 90&#xa0;days (starting 3&#xa0;days before the procedure). In Part I, patients were stratified into a genotype-guided group (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;938) and a conventional group (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;218) according to whether CYP2C19 genotyping was performed. In the genotype-guided group, CYP2C19 rapid metabolizers received clopidogrel (75&#xa0;mg qd) plus aspirin (100&#xa0;mg qd), whereas intermediate or poor metabolizers received ticagrelor (90&#xa0;mg bid) or cilostazol (100&#xa0;mg bid) plus aspirin (100&#xa0;mg qd). The conventional group received clopidogrel plus aspirin. The primary efficacy outcome was new ischemic stroke within 90&#xa0;days. In Part II, genotype-guided patients were further classified into clopidogrel, ticagrelor, and cilostazol subgroups, all combined with aspirin. The primary efficacy endpoint remained 90-day ischemic stroke; the primary safety endpoint was moderate-to-severe bleeding within 90&#xa0;days. Of 1,270 included patients, 1,156 completed 90-day follow-up. Baseline characteristics were balanced between the genotype-guided and conventional groups (all P &gt; 0.05). The 90-day ischemic stroke rate was significantly lower with genotype-guided therapy (3.73&#xa0;% vs 6.88&#xa0;%; P = 0.039). Within the genotype-guided cohort, baseline variables were balanced across clopidogrel (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;386), ticagrelor (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;330), and cilostazol (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;222) subgroups (all P &gt; 0.05). A significant difference in ischemic stroke rates was observed among the three DAPT regimens (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.034), forming an efficacy gradient: clopidogrel in rapid metabolizers (2.33&#xa0;%), ticagrelor (3.63&#xa0;%), and cilostazol (5.96&#xa0;%). Post-hoc analysis showed a higher risk with cilostazol versus clopidogrel (relative risk 2.55; P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.0097). The incidence of moderate-to-severe bleeding was similar low across all groups (clopidogrel 0.42&#xa0;%, ticagrelor 0.61&#xa0;%, cilostazol 0.33&#xa0;%; P &gt; 0.05), However, ticagrelor was associated with a significantly higher rate of any bleeding event (7.27&#xa0;%) compared to both clopidogrel (2.33&#xa0;%) and cilostazol (0.99&#xa0;%). Multivariable analysis established the DAPT regimen as an independent predictor of ischemic stroke. CYP2C19 genotype- DAPT significantly reduces the risk of ischemic stroke within 90&#xa0;days after intracranial or extracranial stenting. For CYP2C19 loss-of-function allele carriers, ticagrelor plus aspirin offers a more effective antithrombotic effect compared to cilostazol plus aspirin, albeit with a higher risk of manageable bleeding events. An individualized strategy is recommended: ticagrelor should be prioritized for ischemic prevention in most patients, while cilostazol represents a safer alternative for those at very high bleeding risk.

      "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical outcomes of clopidogrel-aspirin therapy initiated between 24 and 72 hours from the symptom onset among patients with minor stroke or transient ischemic attack stratified by CYP2C19 loss-of-function allele status. This was a prespecified secondary analysis of the INSPIRES trial (Intensive Statin and Antiplatelet Therapy for Acute High-Risk Intracranial or Extracranial Atherosclerosis), which was a randomized clinical trial conducted across 222 centers in China from September 2018 to October 2022. Two loss-of-function alleles ( CYP2C19*2 , CYP2C19*3 ) and 1 gain-of-function allele ( CYP2C19*17 ) were genotyped in the INSPIRES study. Patients with CYP2C19 loss-of-function allele carriers were patients with either CYP2C19*2 or CYP2C19*3 . All participants were randomized to receive clopidogrel-aspirin or aspirin treatment, and those started treatment between 24 and 72 hours from the symptom onset were included in this study. The primary efficacy outcome was new stroke within 90 days. The primary safety outcome was moderate-to-severe bleeding. Cox proportional hazards models were performed to estimate the interaction between treatment assignment and CYP2C19 loss-of-function allele status for the primary outcomes. Among 5003 patients, 2911 (58.2%) patients were loss-of-function carriers, and 2092 (41.8%) patients were noncarriers. Relative to aspirin alone, clopidogrel-aspirin reduced the rate of new stroke in the noncarriers (hazard ratio, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.49-0.91]; P =0.01) but not in the carriers (hazard ratio, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.73-1.25], P =0.74; P =0.09 for interaction). For the safety outcome, moderate-to-severe bleeding did not vary significantly between the carriers (hazard ratio, 1.83 [95% CI, 0.68-4.95]; P =0.23) and noncarriers (hazard ratio, 2.07 [95% CI, 0.62-6.88], P =0.23; P =0.88 for interaction). Clopidogrel-aspirin treatment presented a priority to aspirin in reducing the risk of new stroke in CYP2C1 9 loss-of-function noncarriers when administered between 24 and 72 hours after stroke onset. These findings supported the necessity of CYP2C19 genotyping in the choice of antiplatelet therapy with an extended treatment window to 72 hours.

      "title": "PCISOS Risk Profiles Stratify Heterogeneous Outcomes in Minor Posterior Circulation Ischemic Stroke: A Post Hoc Analysis of the CHANCE-2 Trial.",
      "abstract": "Risk stratification in posterior circulation ischemic stroke (PCIS) is challenging. Although the Posterior Circulation Ischemic Stroke Outcome Score (PCISOS) was developed to address this, its utility in minor PCIS and in identifying homogeneous populations for clinical trials or treatment-responsive subgroups remains uncertain. CHANCE-2 (Ticagrelor or Clopidogrel With Aspirin in High-Risk Patients With Acute Nondisabling Cerebrovascular Events II) was a multicenter, randomized trial that enrolled patients with minor stroke or high-risk transient ischemic attack who carried CYP2C19 loss-of-function alleles. Patients received ticagrelor-aspirin or clopidogrel-aspirin. This secondary analysis included patients with PCIS, stratified into low- (&#x2264;15), intermediate- (16-20), and high-risk (&#x2265;21) groups based on PCISOS. The primary outcome was 90-day stroke recurrence. Outcomes were analyzed using Cox and logistic regression models, adjusting for significantly imbalanced baseline covariates relevant to each comparison. Among 1379 patients with PCIS (median age, 64.0 [56.6-70.7] years; 67.4% male), 90-day stroke recurrence occurred in 6.0%, 8.2%, and 18.5% of the low-, intermediate-, and high-risk PCISOS groups, respectively ( P &lt;0.001). Risk increased progressively (adjusted hazard ratio for intermediate-risk, 1.32 [95% CI, 0.87-2.02]; high-risk, 3.02 [95% CI, 1.52-6.02]; P trend =0.008). Similar associations were observed for modified Rankin Scale score of 2 to 6 outcomes (adjusted odds ratio for intermediate-risk, 2.21 [95% CI, 1.28-3.84]; high-risk, 3.53 [95% CI, 1.42-8.74]; P trend &lt;0.001). A treatment-by-risk interaction was observed: ticagrelor-aspirin reduced the modified Rankin Scale score of 1 to 6 rates in low- and intermediate-risk patients, but not in high-risk patients ( P interaction =0.03). Favorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale score of 0-1) was more common in patients with PCISOS &#x2264;15 than in those with National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score &#x2264;3 ( P =0.02). PCISOS provides effective risk stratification in minor PCIS, identifying subgroups with heterogeneous outcome risks and differential response to ticagrelor-aspirin. Patients with PCISOS &#x2265;21, a high-risk subgroup within National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale-defined minor strokes, remain underexplored and may benefit from tailored strategies in future trials. A threshold of PCISOS &#x2264;15 may more accurately define truly low-risk patients than National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score &#x2264;3, thereby improving trial efficiency and advancing precision in PCIS research.

      "abstract": "Clopidogrel, an antiplatelet agent, is currently licensed in the United Kingdom for the prevention and treatment of atherothrombotic events in cerebrovascular disease, coronary artery disease and peripheral arterial disease. Clopidogrel requires metabolic activation by the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C19 to be effective. CYP2C19 is encoded by a polymorphic gene; variants in the CYP2C19 gene, which vary in frequency in different ethnic groups can abolish, reduce or increase enzyme activity, thereby affecting the conversion of clopidogrel to its active metabolite. Individuals who have either one or two loss-of-function alleles are referred to as intermediate and poor metabolisers, respectively, and in these patients, the clinical effectiveness of clopidogrel is reduced or absent. Any patient about to be prescribed clopidogrel, regardless of the underlying indication, should have pharmacogenetic testing to identify clinically relevant CYP2C19 variants, where testing is available, to optimize their antiplatelet therapy. Clopidogrel use should be avoided in patients with an intermediate or poor CYP2C19 metaboliser phenotype in all approved indications and alternative treatment regimens used as detailed in this guideline. Our guideline is compatible with other international pharmacogenetic prescribing guidelines, but we also provide recommendations in other areas. Summary guidance on a page is provided for each of the indications in Boxes 1-3. This guideline is grounded in the latest evidence in this field but cannot account for all individual factors relevant to patient care. Therefore, prescribers must conduct a thorough assessment of each patient's risk-benefit profile, ensuring that therapy is optimized to maximize benefits while minimizing potential harms. &#xa9; 2025 The Author(s).

      "abstract": "The impact of CYP2C19 genotype in relation to clinical risk is unclear during clopidogrel treatment following drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation. This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic significance of CYP2C19 genotypes based on clinical risk stratification in DES-treated patients. From the nationwide multicenter PTRG-DES (Platelet function and genoType-Related long-term progGosis in DES-treated patients) consortium, patients were classified according to the presence of CYP2C19 loss-of-function (LoF) allele: rapid or normal metabolizers (RMs/NMs) vs. intermediate or poor metabolizers (IMs/PMs), and clinical risk was stratified using the CHADS-P 2 A 2 RC and TRS 2&#xb0;P scores. The primary endpoint (1&#xb0;EP) was a composite of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and stent thrombosis during a 3-year follow-up. Among clopidogrel-treated patients with CYP2C19 genotyping (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;8,163), IMs/PMs (62.1%) demonstrated an increased risk of 1&#xb0;EP compared with RMs/NMs (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.48; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.05-2.07; Log-rank P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), Most notable in those with high CHADS-P2A2RC (&#x2265;&#x2009;4) and TRS 2&#xb0;P (&#x2265;&#x2009;3) scores (HR adj : 1.68; 95% CI: 1.01-2.80; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.047 and HR adj : 1.63; 95% CI: 1.05-2.54; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.029, respectively). In patients with low scores, there was no difference in 1&#xb0;EP between IMs/PMs vs. RMs/NMs; however, an interaction was observed between acute and chronic coronary syndromes for both low CHADS-P 2 A 2 RC (HR adj : 2.12; 95% CI: 1.11-4.03 and HR adj : 0.68; 95% CI: 0.34-1.36; P interaction &#x2009;=&#x2009;0.017) and TRS 2&#xb0;P scores (HR adj : 2.34; 95% CI: 1.07-5.12 and HR adj : 0.52; 95% CI: 0.22-1.17; P interaction &#x2009;=&#x2009;0.008).
