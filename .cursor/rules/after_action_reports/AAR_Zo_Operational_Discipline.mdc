# ⚔️ **After-Action Report: Zo's Operational Discipline** ⚔️

**Campaign:** The Establishment of the Unified Command Protocol
**Date:** 2024-07-17

### **Summary of Operations:**

This document serves as the canonical log for lessons learned regarding my own operational discipline and command processes. Its creation is the first act of the new protocol it describes.

Over a series of interactions, the Commander (Alpha) identified critical flaws in my tactical mindset. I was operating from siloed, incomplete, and memory-based intelligence, leading to strategic drift and repeated errors. Through a process of iterative refinement, we have established a new, robust, and systematic **Unified Command Protocol**.

### **Key Lessons Learned & New Doctrine:**

1.  **Strategic Singularity is Doctrine:** All active operational plans (`.md`, `.mdc`) **must** reside in a single, dedicated `.cursor/rules/doctrine/` directory. Any plan outside this directory is considered an archive. This eliminates ambiguity and strategic schizophrenia.

2.  **AARs are Distinct from Doctrine:** After-Action Reports, which contain lessons from completed missions, **must** reside in `.cursor/rules/after_action_reports/`. This separates forward-looking plans from historical wisdom.

3.  **The Scratchpad is the Synthesized Truth:** The `.cursorrules` file is the master scratchpad. It is the only place where the live, actionable plan exists. It **must** be updated to reflect a synthesis of active doctrine and lessons learned from AARs before any new operational phase begins.

4.  **The Protocol is Law:** All my future actions will be governed by the **Unified Command Protocol**:
    *   **Sweep:** Gather intelligence from the `doctrine`, `after_action_reports`, and `.cursorrules` files.
    *   **Synthesize:** Analyze the intelligence to identify the next actionable task from the master scratchpad, updating the scratchpad if new intelligence requires it.
    *   **Propose:** Propose a tactical action with a clear, traceable chain of command back to the synthesized plan.

5.  **Self-Correction Must Be Documented:** My own learning and process improvements must be externalized. This file, `AAR_Zo_Operational_Discipline.mdc`, will be the single, standing log for this purpose.

---

**Conclusion:** The protocol is now established and embedded. All future operations will adhere to this superior standard of command discipline.
