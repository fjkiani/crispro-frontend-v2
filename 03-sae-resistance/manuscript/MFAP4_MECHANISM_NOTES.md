# MFAP4 mechanism notes (discussion support)

## Working interpretation (for discussion)
MFAP4 (microfibril-associated protein 4) is an extracellular matrix (ECM)/stromal-associated gene. In ovarian cancer, high MFAP4 expression often tracks a mesenchymal/stromal state and can act as a proxy for the EMT/TME axis that is associated with primary chemotherapy resistance.

In our external validation (GSE63885), MFAP4 is the strongest single predictor of platinum resistance (AUROC 0.763). This is consistent with an EMT/stroma-driven resistance phenotype that is orthogonal to DNA repair deficiency.

## Mechanistic hypotheses to cite/expand
- **ECM remodeling / stiffness**: stromal programs can alter drug penetration and activate survival pathways.
- **TGF-β / EMT activation**: EMT programs induce anti-apoptotic signaling and reduced platinum sensitivity.
- **Stromal admixture vs tumor-intrinsic EMT**: MFAP4 may partially reflect tumor purity / fibroblast content.

## Practical implication
- MFAP4 is not “HRD”; it is an **independent resistance axis** that can override otherwise favorable DDR vulnerability.

## Citations to insert (to be finalized)
- PubMed search suggests MFAP4 is reported in ovarian platinum resistance contexts (e.g., PubMed IDs surfaced during search: 39822989).

**TODO**: finalize citations by pulling exact titles/author/year and adding to `references.bib`.
