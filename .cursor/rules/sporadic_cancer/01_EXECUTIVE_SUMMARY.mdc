# 🎯 SPORADIC CANCER - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Definition**: Cancer WITHOUT germline (inherited) mutations  
**Prevalence**: 85-90% of all cancers  
**Strategic Shift**: Germline-centric → Tumor-centric

---

## 📊 **PREVALENCE**

- **Ovarian**: ~85-90% sporadic (non-BRCA)
- **Breast**: ~90-95% sporadic
- **Colorectal**: ~95% sporadic (non-Lynch)
- **Prostate**: ~70% sporadic

**Total Market**: 85-90% of all cancer patients!

---

## 🎯 **CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS**

### **Positive**:
- ✅ Better prognosis (no germline "second hit")
- ✅ Lower family risk (population-level only)

### **Challenges**:
- ⚠️ Standard hereditary-targeted therapies less effective (PARP in non-BRCA)
- 🎯 Tumor genomics CRITICAL for therapy selection

---

## 🎯 **STRATEGIC VALUE**

**Why This Matters**:
- **85-90% of cancers** are sporadic → vast majority need tumor-centric analysis
- **Germline testing alone insufficient** → most patients test negative
- **Treatment line intelligence critical** → cross-resistance complex in sporadic
- **Clinical trial matching** → somatic biomarker trials expanding

**Competitive Advantage**:
- Most platforms focus on hereditary (10-15%)
- We address sporadic (85-90%) with tumor NGS + treatment lines
