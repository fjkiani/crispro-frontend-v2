# Code Example 16 (yaml)

**Category**: pattern
**Priority**: P2
**Source**: Chat log lines 913-981

  Data: Longitudinal genomics + CA-125 + outcomes
  Expected: AUROC 0.70-0.80+ (full multi-modal)
  Status: ❌ LONG-TERM (4-8+ months to acquire)
  Owner: Future work

## **HOW S1 CHANGES AGENT PRIORITIES**

### **Before S1:**

```yaml
UNCLEAR:
  - Why did Resistance Prophet fail? (mysterious)
  - What data do we need? (vague "serial CA-125")
  - What's the validation path? (one big validation)

RISK:
  - Might pursue wrong data sources
  - Might expect PLCO to validate full hypothesis
  - Might not prioritize treatment cohorts
```


***

### **After S1:**

CLEAR:
  ✅ Failure explained: Baseline can't predict adaptive
  ✅ Data priority: Serial CA-125 > MAPK baseline > ctDNA
  ✅ Validation strategy: Phase 1A/1B/1C (staged approach)
  ✅ PLCO role: Kinetics proof, not resistance validation
  ✅ Critical need: Treatment cohorts (S4 execution)

AGENT PRIORITIES UPDATED:

AGENT 2 (ENGINEER):
  OLD: Build generic harness, wait for PLCO
  NEW: Build harness for Phase 1B (kinetics-only validation)
       Focus on PLCO = proof-of-kinetics, not final answer
       Prepare for Phase 1C (when treatment cohort arrives)

AGENT 3 (SCIENTIST):
  OLD: Finish S2 (pathway-kinetic matrix)
  NEW: PRIORITIZE S4 (data source mapping) ← CRITICAL
       Phase 1C requires treatment cohort (serial CA-125 + resistance)
       S4 must identify + acquire this data ASAP
       S2 becomes secondary (literature review can wait)

AGENT 1 (THERAPY FIT):
  OLD: On hold indefinitely
  NEW: Execute Phase 1A (baseline stratification)
       This is WIWFM validation territory (drug efficacy)
       Can run NOW while waiting for Phase 1B/1C data
       Timeline: Week 3 (Jan 17 start)
```
