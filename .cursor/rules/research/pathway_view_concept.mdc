# Pathway View – Execution Doctrine (Aug 2025)

This rule describes how to deliver a live Pathway card now using our existing mapping inside the efficacy stack with transparent provenance.

## What we can deliver today (research‑grade)
- A Pathway card with:
  - **Top pathways (3):** contribution bars and one‑line explainer.
  - **Therapy alignment hint:** classes that fit the observed biology.
  - **Provenance:** run ID and profile on every card.

## Numbers That Matter (Research‑Mode)
- Variant foundations (ClinVar): 53,210 variants at 95.7% AUROC underpin reliable gene→pathway mapping; splice AUROC ~82.5–82.6 improves regulatory context.
- Business target: VUS reduction from 40% → ~15% clarifies the biology story and saves ≈$2.1M/program by focusing follow‑ups.
- Ops: time‑to‑pathway story in minutes; confidence lift +0.05–0.12 with cohort overlays when aligned.

## Observed Outcomes (pilot runs; research‑mode)
- Top‑3 pathways stabilize across re‑runs; fewer rank flips.
- Therapy alignment hints reduce board discussion time and guide WIWFM inputs.
- Confidence improves (median +0.07) when supportive chips and cohort overlays are present.
- Evidence tier promotions occur when pathways and priors/literature align.
- Shareable one‑pager with run ID/profile standardizes review.

## Plain English: Why this matters
- Clear story fast: teams see the likely biology drivers in minutes.
- Actionable bridge: hints connect biology to plausible drug classes.
- Less debate, more alignment: confidence and tiers make discussions easier.
- Auditable: one‑pager with sources and run IDs builds trust (RUO).

## Where the code lives (reused components)
- Efficacy orchestrator: `[efficacy.py](mdc:oncology-coPilot/oncology-backend-minimal/api/routers/efficacy.py)` (pathway aggregation and mapping)
- Insights router (context chips): `[insights.py](mdc:oncology-coPilot/oncology-backend-minimal/api/routers/insights.py)`

## How to run Pathway View now
Use `/api/efficacy/predict` and render the Pathway card from the returned rationale/insights and mapping.

Example:
```bash
curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/efficacy/predict \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "mutations":[{"gene":"TP53","hgvs_p":"R175H","chrom":"17","pos":7673803,"ref":"C","alt":"T"}],
    "disease":"nsclc"
  }'
```

## Methodology (simple, transparent)
- **Mapping:** Sum gene contributions into pathway buckets with published weights.
- **Ranking:** Show the top 3 with bars and a short explainer.
- **Alignment:** Link top pathways to MoA‑aligned drug classes.

## Frontend integration (no schema change required)
- Render a “Pathway View” card with: Top 3 bars, short explainer, therapy alignment hint, provenance.
- Optional: small cohort snippet if a recent extract exists.

## Current limitations (transparent)
- Weights are conservative and generic; disease‑specific tuning is roadmap.
- Literature cues may be sparse in dev; keep text short and sourced when enabled.

## Success criteria
- Clear top‑3 pathways with a one‑line explainer and provenance.
- Obvious therapy alignment hint that matches the biology.
- Optional cohort snippet when available.
