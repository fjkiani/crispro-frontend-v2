   - Estimated time: 5 minutes
   - Priority: HIGH

3. **Generated Tables (0% complete)**
   - Status: Scripts ready, need to run
   - Estimated time: 5 minutes
   - Priority: HIGH

4. **Expanded Validation (23% complete)**
   - Current: 47 trials, 1 patient profile
   - Needed: 200+ trials, 10-20 diverse patient profiles
   - Estimated time: 2-3 weeks
   - Priority: HIGH

5. **Shortlist Compression Validation (0% complete)**
   - Status: Script ready, needs live search infrastructure
   - Estimated time: 1-2 days (when infrastructure ready)
   - Priority: MEDIUM

6. **User Study (0% complete)**
   - Status: Not started
   - Estimated time: 1-2 weeks
   - Priority: LOW (nice to have)
