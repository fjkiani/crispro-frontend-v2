# Code Example 3 (yaml)

**Category**: pattern
**Priority**: P2
**Source**: Chat log lines 61-139

---

  ✅ 7 pathways framework (DDR, MAPK, PI3K, VEGF, HER2, IO, Efflux)
  ✅ TCGA-OV dataset (469 patients, baseline mutations)
  ✅ Ovarian cancer focus (initial validation)

DIFFERENT VALIDATION NEEDS:
  WIWFM:
    - Baseline mutations → Drug rankings
    - Endpoint: Treatment response (sensitive vs resistant)
    - Data: TCGA-OV mutations + platinum response ✅ HAVE
    - Timeline: Can execute now (Week 3-4)
  
  Resistance Prophet:
    - Baseline + kinetics → Resistance timing
    - Endpoint: Time to resistance (weeks 6-18)
    - Data: Serial CA-125 + mutations ❌ DON'T HAVE (yet)
    - Timeline: 3-7 weeks (waiting on PLCO or collaborators)

ALIGNMENT QUESTION:
  Do we execute sequentially (RP first, then WIWFM)?
  Or parallel (both at once)?
  Or opportunistic (WIWFM now, RP when data arrives)?
```

## **RECOMMENDED ALIGNMENT: HYBRID PARALLEL**

### **Week 1-2 (Now - Jan 10): PLCO Wait Period**

AGENT 2 (ENGINEER):
  PRIMARY: Build validation harness (D3)
    - Data ingestion pipeline (CSV → kinetics computation)
    - KELIM computation module (velocity, acceleration, slopes)
    - Model training framework (logistic regression, random forest)
    - Validation metrics (AUROC, sensitivity, specificity, lead time)
    - Output: Ready-to-run harness for PLCO data when arrives
  
  SECONDARY: Synthetic validation (proof-of-concept)
    - Use existing synthetic CA-125 generator
    - Validate harness works (AUROC 1.0 on synthetic = sanity check)
    - Debug any infrastructure issues
  
  TIMELINE: 8-12 hours (spread over 1-2 weeks)
  BLOCKING: PLCO approval (can't validate on real data yet)

AGENT 3 (SCIENTIST):
  PRIMARY: S4 - Data source mapping (8 hours)
    - Identify treatment cohorts with serial CA-125
    - Priority: GOG-218, ICON7, CHIVA, GCIG meta-analysis
    - Contact info for collaborators (KELIM, Institut Curie)
    - Draft outreach emails (use D4 protocol templates)
    - OUTPUT: Ranked list of cohorts + access strategy
  
  SECONDARY: S2 completion (6 hours remaining)
    - Finish pathway-kinetic matrix
    - 20-30 pairs from literature
    - Feed into S3 (hypotheses)
  
  TIMELINE: 14 hours total (spread over 1-2 weeks)
  BLOCKING: None (literature-based work)

AGENT 1 (THERAPY FIT):
  STATUS: On hold (Week 3-4 execution)
  RATIONALE: 
    - Agents 2+3 focused on Resistance Prophet infrastructure
    - WIWFM validation can wait (proven framework, low risk)
    - Execute when RP infrastructure built (avoid bandwidth split)
```
