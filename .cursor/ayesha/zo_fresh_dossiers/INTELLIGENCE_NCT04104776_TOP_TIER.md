## 🎯 WHY THIS TRIAL IS A GOOD FIT FOR AYESHA (LLM Analysis)

### **Clinical Analysis: Suitability of NCT04104776 for Ayesha Kiani**

**TO:** Ayesha Kiani's Clinical Care Team
**FROM:** Clinical Oncology Expert
**RE:** Analysis of Tulmimetostat (NCT04104776) for First-Line Treatment of Stage IVB HGSOC

This analysis concludes that the Tulmimetostat trial (NCT04104776) is **not a suitable option** for Ms. Kiani at this time. The primary reasons are a fundamental mismatch in the treatment line eligibility, the unproven efficacy of the investigational agent compared to a highly effective standard-of-care, and significant safety concerns given her clinical presentation.

---

#### **1. Drug Mechanism Fit**

Tulmimetostat is a dual inhibitor of EZH2 and EZH1, enzymes involved in epigenetic gene silencing. Overexpression of EZH2 is implicated in the pathogenesis and chemoresistance of High-Grade Serous Ovarian Carcinoma (HGSOC). Therefore, there is a sound biological rationale for investigating this agent in HGSOC.

However, the fit for Ms. Kiani is theoretical and non-specific. This trial's Phase 2 expansion cohorts are enrolling patients with known ARID1A mutations, a biomarker sometimes associated with sensitivity to EZH2 inhibitors. Ms. Kiani's ARID1A status is unknown. Without a predictive biomarker, enrolling her in this trial would be an untargeted approach. Given her BRCA-negative status, exploring therapies with a defined mechanism in her tumor type is less compelling than pursuing the established standard of care.

#### **2. Location Logistics**

The trial has sites at NYU Langone and Weill Cornell, both of which are highly accessible from Ms. Kiani's residence in East Harlem (ZIP 10029). Travel time via public transit or car service to either location would be approximately 20-40 minutes, making the logistics feasible. If she is already receiving care at Mount Sinai (located very near her ZIP code), transitioning to a different academic center for a clinical trial would introduce logistical and care-coordination complexities, but the proximity of the trial sites themselves is not a barrier.

#### **3. Risk-Benefit for Ayesha**

The risk-benefit profile is strongly unfavorable for Ms. Kiani in this context.

*   **Risks:**
    *   **Pulmonary Compromise:** Her large bilateral pleural effusions are a direct consequence of her extensive tumor burden. The primary goal of initial therapy must be rapid disease control to alleviate this life-threatening symptom. A first-in-human (FIH) monotherapy trial, where the initial cohorts receive low, sub-therapeutic doses for safety evaluation, poses an unacceptably high risk of disease progression and worsening respiratory failure.
    *   **Toxicity of an Unknown Profile:** While her ECOG 1 status is good, the full toxicity profile of Tulmimetostat is still being defined. Common class effects of EZH2 inhibitors include myelosuppression (thrombocytopenia, neutropenia) and fatigue. Worsening fatigue or a neutropenic infection could be poorly tolerated in a patient with pre-existing pulmonary compromise.
    *   **Opportunity Cost:** The most significant risk is forgoing a proven, highly effective first-line therapy.

*   **Benefits:** The potential benefit is access to a novel agent. However, in a FIH monotherapy setting for a treatment-naive patient with extensive disease, the probability of a rapid, durable response sufficient to control her symptoms is exceedingly low.

#### **4. Comparison to Standard of Care**

The planned Standard of Care (SOC)—Carboplatin, Paclitaxel, and Bevacizumab—is a robust, evidence-based regimen with high response rates (often >70%) in first-line HGSOC. This combination is designed for maximal cytoreduction, symptom palliation, and prolongation of progression-free survival. Its efficacy and safety profiles are well-established.

In contrast, the Tulmimetostat trial is a Phase 1 study where the primary endpoints are safety and dose-finding, not efficacy. As a monotherapy, it is exceptionally unlikely to match, let alone exceed, the efficacy of the SOC triplet. Replacing a proven, life-prolonging regimen with an experimental monotherapy in the first-line setting would be a significant deviation from established clinical practice and would not be in Ms. Kiani's best interest.

#### **5. Critical Considerations**

1.  **Ineligibility Based on Treatment Line:** This is the most critical point. The trial's eligibility criteria explicitly state it is for patients who have "relapsed following standard therapy or progressed through standard therapy." As a treatment-naive patient, Ms. Kiani does not meet the fundamental entry criteria. This alone disqualifies her from consideration.

2.  **Urgency of Disease Control:** With a CA-125 of 2842 and large pleural effusions, her disease requires immediate and effective control. The SOC provides the best and fastest path to achieving this. Delaying effective therapy to pursue an inappropriate trial could lead to rapid clinical deterioration.

3.  **Future Trial Opportunities:** The appropriate time to consider Phase 1 trials like this is after progression on standard therapies. Ms. Kiani should focus on her first-line treatment. Comprehensive genomic profiling of her tumor now can identify potential biomarkers (like ARID1A, HRD status) that could guide her into a more appropriate, targeted trial in a future line of therapy.

**Recommendation:** Proceed with the planned standard of care (Carboplatin + Paclitaxel + Bevacizumab) without delay. This trial is not an appropriate option for Ms. Kiani.
