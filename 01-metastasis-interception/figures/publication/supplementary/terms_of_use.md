# AlphaFold 3 Server Terms of Use Compliance

## Service Information

**Platform**: AlphaFold Server  
**Provider**: Google DeepMind / Isomorphic Labs  
**URL**: https://golgi.sandbox.google.com/about  
**Version**: AlphaFold 3 (Abramson et al., 2024, Nature)

## Terms of Service (Summary)

This work complies with the AlphaFold 3 Server Terms of Service as of October 2024:

### Permitted Use
- **Non-Commercial Research**: Academic and non-profit research only
- **Educational Use**: Teaching and training purposes
- **Publication**: Results may be published in peer-reviewed journals with proper attribution
- **Data Sharing**: Structures may be deposited in public repositories (e.g., Protein Data Bank, Zenodo)

### Prohibited Use
- **Commercial Use**: No commercial drug development, diagnostics, or therapeutic applications without separate licensing
- **Clinical Applications**: No use in clinical decision-making or patient care
- **Resale**: No redistribution of the service or derived data for profit
- **Reverse Engineering**: No attempts to reverse engineer the AlphaFold 3 model weights or architecture

### Attribution Requirements
All publications using AlphaFold 3 Server must cite:
- **Primary Citation**: Abramson, J. et al. Accurate structure prediction of biomolecular interactions with AlphaFold 3. *Nature* **630**, 493–500 (2024).
- **Service Acknowledgment**: "Structures were predicted using the AlphaFold 3 Server (Google DeepMind, 2024)."

### Data Retention and Privacy
- **Submitted Data**: Sequences and structures submitted to the server are processed according to Google's privacy policy
- **Result Retention**: Predictions are retained on the server for 30 days; users are responsible for downloading results
- **Public Sharing**: Users may share prediction results publicly with proper attribution

## Compliance Statement for This Work

### Our Use Case
- **Purpose**: Academic research for peer-reviewed publication
- **Application**: Computational validation of CRISPR guide RNA designs for cancer metastasis intervention
- **Commercial Status**: Non-commercial, research-only
- **Clinical Status**: Explicitly marked "Research Use Only" throughout all materials

### Attribution
This work cites AlphaFold 3 in:
- Abstract
- Methods section
- Results section
- All figure legends containing structural data
- Supplementary materials

### Data Sharing
All AlphaFold 3 predictions from this work are:
- Archived in Supplementary Data S1
- Deposited on Zenodo with DOI (pending)
- Shared with full provenance (submission JSONs, output CIFs, confidence metrics)
- Clearly marked as AlphaFold 3 Server predictions

### Research Use Only Disclaimers
All structural validation results include explicit "Research Use Only" disclaimers in:
- Abstract
- Methods
- Results
- Figure legends
- Supplementary materials
- Data availability statements

## Limitations and Disclaimers

### Computational Predictions
AlphaFold 3 predictions are computational models and do not represent experimentally determined structures. Users must:
- Validate predictions experimentally before drawing biological conclusions
- Not use predictions for clinical decision-making
- Report confidence metrics (pLDDT, iPTM) alongside all structures
- Acknowledge limitations of the prediction method

### No Warranty
AlphaFold 3 Server is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind. Google DeepMind does not guarantee:
- Accuracy of predictions
- Availability or uptime of the service
- Fitness for any particular purpose
- Support or maintenance

## Future Commercial Use Pathway

If this research progresses to commercial applications (e.g., therapeutic development), we will:
1. Obtain appropriate commercial licensing from Google DeepMind / Isomorphic Labs
2. Re-validate structures using internal AlphaFold 3 deployment or experimental methods (X-ray, cryo-EM)
3. Update all publications and regulatory filings with proper commercial licensing acknowledgment
4. Comply with all intellectual property and licensing requirements
