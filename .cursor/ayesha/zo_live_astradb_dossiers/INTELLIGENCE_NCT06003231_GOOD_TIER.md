|-----------|-----------------|-------|-----------------|
| Stage IV epithelial ovarian | Stage IVB High-Grade Serous Ovarian Carcinoma (HGSOC) | ✅ PASS | None |
| BRCA wildtype | Germline negative | ✅ PASS | None |
| HER2 Status | UNKNOWN | ⚠️ GATE | HER2 IHC (3-5 days) |
| HRD Status | UNKNOWN | ⚠️ PENDING | MyChoice CDx (7-10 days) |
| Treatment Line | first-line | ✅ PASS | None |
| Tissue Available | True | ✅ PASS | None |

## 🎯 WHY THIS TRIAL IS A GOOD FIT FOR AYESHA (LLM Analysis)

### **Clinical Trial Analysis: NCT06003231**

**Note**: This is a structured fallback analysis (LLM unavailable).

#### **1. Drug Mechanism Fit**
The trial "A Study of Disitamab Vedotin in Previously Treated Solid Tumors That Express HER2" requires detailed mechanism analysis. Review the trial protocol to understand how the investigational drug addresses Ayesha's Stage IVB High-Grade Serous Ovarian Carcinoma with extensive tumor burden and pleural metastases.

#### **2. Location Logistics**
Review trial locations to identify NYC metro sites accessible from ZIP 10029 (East Harlem). Preferred centers: Mount Sinai (local), MSK (2 miles), NYU Langone (3-4 miles).

#### **3. Risk-Benefit for Ayesha**
**Key Considerations**:
- Pulmonary compromise: Large bilateral pleural effusions require careful monitoring
- ECOG 1: Acceptable for most trials, but toxicity profile is critical
- Tumor burden: Extensive disease (CA-125 >2800) may require aggressive initial treatment

#### **4. Comparison to Standard of Care**
Ayesha's planned SOC is Carboplatin + Paclitaxel + Bevacizumab (NCCN-guideline first-line therapy for Stage IVB HGSOC, BRCA wildtype). This trial should be compared to this regimen to assess:
- Is it a replacement for SOC (frontline trial)?
- Is it additional to SOC (maintenance trial)?
- Is it an alternative if SOC fails?

#### **5. Critical Considerations**
1. **Biomarker testing**: HER2 and HRD status are unknown - may be required for enrollment
2. **Timing**: When should Ayesha enroll? Before SOC, during SOC, or after response?
3. **Clinical team review**: Discuss with Ayesha's oncologist before enrollment decisions

**Recommendation**: Full protocol review with clinical team required.

## 📊 TRIAL DESCRIPTION

This clinical trial is studying advanced or metastatic solid tumors. Once a solid tumor has grown very large in one spot or has spread to other places in the body, it is called advanced or metastatic cancer. Participants in this study must have head and neck cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, endometrial cancer, or ovarian cancer. In the first part of the study, participants must have tumors that have a marker called HER2.

This clinical trial uses an experimental drug called disitamab vedotin (DV). DV is a type of antibody-drug conjugate or ADC. ADCs are designed to stick to cancer cells and kill them. In this study, all participants will get DV once every 2 weeks.

This study is being done to see if DV works to treat different types of solid tumors that express HER2. It will also test how safe the drug is for participants. This trial will also study what side effects happen when participants get the drug. A side effect is anything a drug does to your body besides treating the disease.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL GATES FOR AYESHA

### HER2 Testing (Priority: P0 - URGENT)
**Status**: PENDING  
**Test**: HER2 IHC (ASCO-CAP gastric scoring)  
**Turnaround**: 3-5 days  
**Cost**: $200-400  
**Rationale**: HER2 status unknown - testing required. If IHC 1+/2+ (expression, not amplification), Ayesha may be eligible for breakthrough T-DXd trial.

## ⚔️ TACTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS

**Priority**: ⚠️ **P1 - HIGH PRIORITY** (Eligibility: ~0%)

**Next Steps**:
1. **Review eligibility carefully** (with oncologist)
2. **Order pending biomarker tests** (if required)
3. **Contact trial site** (within 1 week)
4. **Backup option** (if top-tier trials fail)

## 🎯 VALUE PROPOSITION

**LOW PROBABILITY SCENARIO**:
- Eligibility: ~0% (low)
- Consider alternative trials with better match
- Keep as backup option
