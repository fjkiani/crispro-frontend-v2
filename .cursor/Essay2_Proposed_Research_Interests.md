# Proposed Research Interests

My computational oncology work predicts which genes drive metastasis and which drugs match a patient's variants—but only at a single timepoint. I cannot model how tumor subclones evolve resistance, which escape routes they take under therapeutic pressure, or when to switch therapies as clonal fitness landscapes shift. This is an evolutionary biology problem, not an engineering problem.

I need to answer four questions that engineering alone cannot solve.

**How do I model clonal evolution under drug selection?** My resistance prediction system flags risk markers at diagnosis, but those are static. When my sister Ayesha continues PARP inhibitor therapy for stage IV ovarian cancer, I need to forecast not just whether resistance will emerge, but which resistant clone will outcompete others and when. I need stochastic birth-death models for clonal competition, Bayesian inference frameworks to estimate clonal fitness from single-cell sequencing data, and Wright-Fisher models to predict which subclones will dominate under specific drug selection pressures.

**When did cancer acquire the escape mechanisms I'm trying to block?** My metastasis framework targets eight biological steps, but I don't know which pathways are evolutionarily ancient—and therefore hard to bypass—versus recently acquired and therefore plastic. If EMT programs are deeply conserved across vertebrates, tumor cells may have limited escape routes from EMT-targeting interventions. If dormancy mechanisms are evolutionarily young, they may admit compensatory pathways I haven't identified. I need phylogenetic comparative methods to distinguish conserved vulnerabilities from plastic ones.

**How do I design therapeutic schedules that account for clonal dynamics?** If Ayesha continues with PARP inhibitors, which resistant subclone will dominate at six months—HR restoration through RAD51C reactivation, or drug efflux through ABCB1 upregulation? I need quantitative frameworks for sequential drug scheduling informed by evolutionary game theory, where each drug applies different selection pressures and the optimal sequence minimizes multi-drug resistant clones.

**How do I validate evolutionary predictions in real patients?** I've validated static predictions in 1,464 cancer patients. But Ayesha's tumor will be sequenced again at 6 and 12 months under therapy. I need phylogenetic methods to reconstruct her clonal lineage tree from longitudinal sequencing, dN/dS analysis to detect positive selection on resistant subclones, and population genetics frameworks to quantify selection coefficients before resistant clones dominate.

Richard Gilder Graduate School is one of the few programs where rigorous evolutionary biology training is embedded in a museum-scale comparative genomics environment. I am particularly drawn to Dr. Robert DeSalle's work on phylogenetic bioinformatics and genome-wide comparative genomics, Dr. Brian T. Smith's phylogenomic analysis and statistical modeling of evolutionary dynamics, and Dr. Frank T. Burbrink's comparative genomics and positive selection analysis. I want to apply their methods to clonal lineage reconstruction, selection quantification on resistance pathways, and testing whether DNA repair epistasis is conserved across vertebrates or evolutionarily plastic.

I bring validated computational infrastructure (CrisPRO.ai) and longitudinal sequencing data from ongoing patient cases including Ayesha's. I am not starting from scratch—I'm bringing tools and data that can immediately interface with the Museum's evolutionary biology training.
