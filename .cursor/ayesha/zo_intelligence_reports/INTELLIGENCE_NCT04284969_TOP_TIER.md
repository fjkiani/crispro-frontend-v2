## 🎯 WHY THIS TRIAL IS A GOOD FIT FOR AYESHA (LLM Analysis)

### **Clinical Trial Analysis: PROADAPT-ovary (NCT04284969)**

This analysis concludes that patient AK is **not eligible** for the PROADAPT-ovary trial. The study is fundamentally mismatched to her demographic profile and is a non-therapeutic, supportive care intervention.

---

#### **1. Drug Mechanism Fit**
This is not a drug trial. The PROADAPT intervention is a supportive care program focused on geriatric prehabilitation, surgical optimization, and post-discharge care for elderly patients. It has no direct anti-tumor mechanism and is not designed to treat high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma. The trial's purpose is to improve tolerance and recovery from standard-of-care surgery in a specific elderly population, not to serve as a primary cancer therapy.

#### **2. Location Logistics**
As noted, there are **no participating sites in the NYC metro area**. The trial is therefore geographically inaccessible to Ayesha, irrespective of her clinical eligibility.

#### **3. Risk-Benefit for Ayesha**
A formal risk-benefit analysis is not applicable as Ayesha is ineligible.

*   **Ineligibility:** The primary inclusion criterion is age ≥70 years, or ≥60 with significant comorbidities. At age 40, Ayesha is definitively excluded.
*   **Pulmonary Compromise & Tumor Burden:** While a prehabilitation program could theoretically benefit a patient with a high disease burden and compromised pulmonary function preparing for surgery, this specific geriatric-focused protocol is not designed for or tested in her younger patient population.
*   **Performance Status (ECOG 1):** Her good performance status is suitable for aggressive therapy but does not override the age exclusion criterion.

#### **4. Comparison to Standard of Care (SOC)**
This trial is **not an alternative** to her planned SOC (Carboplatin + Paclitaxel + Bevacizumab). It is an adjunctive intervention that would be administered *in addition* to a standard therapeutic regimen like neoadjuvant chemotherapy and surgery. The trial does not compare a new therapy to SOC; it evaluates a supportive care framework alongside SOC for an elderly cohort. Therefore, it cannot be considered "better" or "worse" than her planned treatment.

#### **5. Critical Considerations & Recommendation**
The single most critical point is Ayesha's age (40), which makes her **categorically ineligible** for this geriatric-focused study.

**Recommendation:** Ayesha should not pursue this trial. Her focus should be on initiating her planned first-line systemic therapy. Concurrently, she should explore first-line therapeutic trials appropriate for a younger, newly diagnosed Stage IVB HGSOC patient. The pending HRD status is a critical biomarker that will dictate eligibility for trials involving PARP inhibitors, which are a cornerstone of modern ovarian cancer management. This trial is not a relevant option and should be disregarded.

💡 STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS

### Best-Case Scenario:
✅ Ayesha enrolls in NCT04284969
✅ Access to experimental therapy
✅ Close monitoring, expert care
**Probability**: ~50%

### Most Likely Scenario:
Ayesha completes screening and enrolls successfully

### Challenge Scenario:
Screen failure due to other eligibility criteria (performance status, organ function, etc.)

## 📊 TRIAL DESCRIPTION

PROADAPT is a standardized geriatric intervention that is currently being co-constructed during an exploratory phase on a multi-professional and multi-disciplinary basis after a systematic analysis of published data (Figure).

It consists in: 1) before surgery: a prehabilitation of the patients including a nutritional, physical and educational preparation; 2) during the hospitalization for surgery: an optimisation of their treatments through a pharmaceutical conciliation, educational interventions, standardization of surgical procedures and enhanced rehabilitation after surgery; 3) bridging and post-discharge interventions for hospital-to-home transition.

This intervention is based on a logic change model, constructed with literature data and validated by an expert group through a DELPHI method : the rehabilitation model.

This intervention was designed to be implemented pragmatically in the centers according local habits and is currently being evaluated in several distinct hospital contexts under the name of "PROADAPT pilot study" in different tumor contexts thanks to a grant from the Regional Health Agency of Rhône-Alpes Auvergne region.

PROADAPT intervention is planned to be evaluated in 4 tumor models inducing complex medico-surgical procedures considered at high risk of geriatric deconditioning. They have the same primary objectives in order to be evaluated into a meta-analysis. Results will be used to test the validity of the rehabilitation model. Therefore, it is a study reaching the goal of the population health intervention research.

The purpose of the PROADAPT-ovary/EWOC-2 study is to evaluate the impact of PROADAPT on patient's post-surgical outcomes in patients ≥ 70 years old with an advanced ovarian cancer (AOC).

## ⚔️ TACTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS

**Priority**: 🔥 **P0 - IMMEDIATE ACTION** (Eligibility: ~50%)

**Next Steps**:
1. **Order biomarker tests** (HER2 IHC, HRD if not done)
2. **Contact trial site** (within 48 hours)
3. **Pre-screen Ayesha** (get on coordinator's radar)
4. **Decision at Week 2**: Enroll if eligible
5. **Prepare medical records** (surgical report, pathology, CA-125 history)

**Expected Timeline**:
- Week 1: Complete L1 chemo (cycle 6)
- Week 2: Biomarker results available
- Week 3: Enroll in trial (if eligible) or proceed with SOC maintenance


---

## 🎯 VALUE PROPOSITION

**WIN-WIN SCENARIO**:
- If eligible (50% chance) → Access to experimental therapy
- If not eligible → Gets proven SOC (PARP or bevacizumab maintenance)
- Either way, Ayesha receives appropriate care

**Risk-Benefit**: Low risk (pre-screening doesn't commit to enrollment), high reward (cutting-edge therapy)
