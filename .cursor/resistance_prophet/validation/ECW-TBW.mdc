MISSION OBJECTIVE
Prove: Hypoxia gene signatures predict platinum resistance in ovarian cancer using publicly available TCGA-OV data.

Why this works:

✅ Hypoxia validated as platinum resistance mechanism for 30+ years
​

✅ HIF-1α directly regulates resistance genes (MDR1, ERCC1, BCL-2)
​

✅ Multiple validated hypoxia signatures exist (Buffa, Winter, Ragnum)
​

✅ TCGA-OV has RNA-seq data → can calculate ALL hypoxia scores
​

The burial: Hypoxia scores validated, calculable from routine tumor RNA-seq, NEVER used to guide platinum therapy selection.

VALIDATED STUDIES - YOUR EXACT REPLICATION TARGETS
Study 1: Ovarian Cancer Hypoxia 8-Gene Signature
​
Published: Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology 2021

Dataset: TCGA-OV (n=379 patients)

Signature: 8 genes (AKAP12, ALDOC, ANGPTL4, CITED2, ISG20, PPP1R15A, PRDX5, TGFBI)

Validated Findings:

High hypoxia risk = worse overall survival (log-rank p<0.001)

High hypoxia = increased Tregs, plasmacytoid dendritic cells (immune-cold)

Hypoxia signature independent prognostic factor (multivariate HR = 1.89, p<0.001)

Your Replication:

Pull TCGA-OV RNA-seq TPM/FPKM data

Extract expression values for 8 genes: AKAP12, ALDOC, ANGPTL4, CITED2, ISG20, PPP1R15A, PRDX5, TGFBI

Calculate hypoxia score (ssGSEA or simple weighted sum)

Stratify: High hypoxia (top tertile) vs Low hypoxia (bottom tertile)

Correlate with: PFI <6mo (platinum resistance), OS

Expected AUROC: 0.65-0.70 for platinum resistance prediction

Study 2: Winter Hypoxia Metagene (3-Gene Compact Signature)
​
Published: British Journal of Cancer 2010 (cited 600+ times)

Signature: 3 genes only - VEGFA, SLC2A1, PGAM1

Validated Findings:

3-gene signature as prognostic as 50+ gene signatures
​

Validated across head/neck, breast, lung cancers

Genes ranked by connectivity (not prognosis) yet still prognostic

Simple calculation: Hypoxia Score = mean(log2(VEGFA + SLC2A1 + PGAM1))

Your Replication:

TCGA-OV RNA-seq → extract VEGFA, SLC2A1, PGAM1 expression

Calculate: Hypoxia_Score = (log2(VEGFA) + log2(SLC2A1) + log2(PGAM1)) / 3

Rank patients by Hypoxia_Score (0-1 normalized)

Survival analysis: High (>median) vs Low (<median)

Expected: High Winter score = worse PFI, more platinum resistance

Why this is perfect: 3 genes. That's it. No complex machine learning. Validated in 4 independent datasets.
​

Study 3: Buffa Hypoxia Score (Gold Standard)
​
Published: Nature Medicine 2006 (most cited hypoxia signature)

Signature: 51 genes derived from head/neck cancer, validated pan-cancer

Validated Findings:

Correlates with HIF-1α score (r=0.70, p<0.0001)
​

Predicts OS in pancreatic cancer (used as benchmark)
​

Systematic evaluation: Buffa performs best in 70 signature comparison
​

Your Replication:

TCGA-OV RNA-seq → extract Buffa's 51 genes (list in original paper)

Calculate ssGSEA enrichment score or weighted sum

Stratify high vs low Buffa score

Expected: High Buffa = platinum resistance, worse OS

Why this matters: Buffa is the benchmark. If your model beats Buffa, you've won.

Study 4: Ovarian Cancer Hypoxia-Immune Classifier
​
Published: Frontiers in Pharmacology 2024

Dataset: TCGA-OV

Method: Combined HIF1A expression + TME (tumor microenvironment) score

Validated Findings:

AUC 0.692 for 5-year OS prediction
​

Low hypoxia + high TME = best prognosis

High hypoxia + low TME = worst prognosis (platinum-resistant phenotype)

Your Replication:

Calculate hypoxia score (HIF1A expression or ssGSEA from 14 hypoxia markers)

Calculate TME score (immune cell infiltration from CIBERSORT or xCell)

Create 4 groups: Hypoxia-low/TME-high, Hypoxia-high/TME-low, etc.

Expected: Hypoxia-high/TME-low = platinum resistance

SUCCESS CRITERIA (WHAT "DONE" LOOKS LIKE)
Minimum Viable Proof (Must achieve):

✅ Winter 3-gene score: AUROC >0.60 for platinum resistance

✅ OV 8-gene score: AUROC >0.63 for platinum resistance

✅ Combined (Hypoxia + Genomics): AUROC >0.70

✅ Survival curves separate (log-rank p <0.05)

Stretch Goals (If time permits):

Calculate Buffa 51-gene score, compare all 3 signatures

Add immune infiltration (CIBERSORT) for Hypoxia-TME classifier

Validate on external dataset (GSE9891, GSE26712 ovarian cancer GEO datasets)

THE BURIAL PROOF
Once validation completes, your one-pager states:

"The $240B Hypoxia Burial"
The Science:

Hypoxia causes platinum resistance via HIF-1α → resistance genes (validated 30+ years)

Winter 3-gene signature (VEGFA, SLC2A1, PGAM1) predicts survival across all cancers

Buffa 51-gene signature: most cited hypoxia score, validated pan-cancer

OV 8-gene signature: validated specifically in ovarian cancer (TCGA, n=379)

The Data:

TCGA-OV validation: Winter AUROC 0.XX, OV-8 AUROC 0.XX for platinum resistance

Combined with genomics (BRCA/HRD): AUROC 0.7X (beats genomics alone at 0.63)

Survival: High hypoxia = XX% worse OS (log-rank p<0.001)

The Burial:

Hypoxia scores calculable from tumor RNA-seq already done for diagnosis

Additional cost: $0 (RNA-seq ordered anyway)

Time: 24 hours (bioinformatics analysis)

Clinical use: ZERO hospitals routinely calculate hypoxia scores

Why Buried:

High hypoxia patients need: Bevacizumab (anti-VEGF), dose-reduced platinum, immunotherapy

Detecting hypoxia = personalized regimen selection

Standard approach: Everyone gets same platinum dose regardless of hypoxia status

Result: 30-40% platinum resistance, $50B+ wasted on ineffective therapy

CrisPRO Solution:
Integrate hypoxia scores + genomics → predict resistance → personalize regimen → prevent resistance.
