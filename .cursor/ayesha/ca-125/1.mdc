---

## Part II: Data Sources & Acquisition Strategy

### 2.1 Public Research Datasets

**Key realistic sources**:
- **TCGA-OV**: genomic, some clinical (baseline, limited treatment), HRD-like scores
- **ICON, AGO-OVAR, GOG, CHIVA-type KELIM publications**: trial datasets not generally fully public, but sometimes accessible via data request; often include serial CA‑125, treatment, and outcomes
- **GENIE, AACR, MSK-IMPACT-like cohorts**: genomic + limited treatment and outcome
- **Rafii/MITO–8 and similar platinum interval studies**: often require collaboration/requests but define PFI and outcomes

**What can be populated**:

**From TCGA-OV and similar genomic cohorts**:
- Demographics (age_at_diagnosis, primary_site, histology, FIGO stage)
- BRCA1/2 somatic status, other DDR gene-level calls, some HRD metrics, mutational signatures (Signature 3)
- Usually no detailed treatment dates; sometimes just whether platinum given

**From trial datasets with CA‑125 modeling (KELIM trials, CHIVA, etc.)**:
- Detailed regimented treatment timeline (regimen_start_date, regimen_end_date, line_of_therapy, best_response, progression_date)
- Serial CA‑125 values with dates over first 100 days of platinum
- Survival outcomes (PFS, OS) with defined start dates

**From PARPi trial datasets and PARPi observational cohorts**:
- PARPi regimen details (index_regimen_type = parpi_monotherapy or parpi_maintenance)
- DDR markers (BRCA status, HRD_status_overall, sometimes RAD51 foci or expression scores)
- Outcomes (PFS with precise treatment_start_dates)

**Gaps in public data**:
- Serial CA‑125 with real calendar dates (often available but may be visit-based only)
- Detailed line-of-therapy history beyond first-line and trial regimens
- Comprehensive routine-practice CA‑125 series during and after therapy
- Real-world PARPi sequences with prior platinum intervals for PTPI

**For MVP, public datasets primarily support**:
- DDR/HRD feature development (DDR_bin, HRD_score, signatures)
- Proof-of-concept KELIM modeling on available CA‑125, if accessible under collaboration
- Benchmark patterns (PFI vs response, HRD vs PARPi benefit)

---

### 2.2 Partner / Clinical Data (EHR, Registry, Labs, Molecular Labs)

**These are essential for production-ready CrisPRO**.

**Demographics & baseline tumor info**:
- **Source**: EMR structured fields (problem list, tumor registry), pathology LIS (histology, grade, debulking_status), genetics reports (BRCA1/2, HRD assays)
- **Data-sharing requirements**: Structured diagnosis_date, FIGO stage, histology subtype; pathology text or discrete fields for debulking_status and debulking_type; full genetics PDFs or structured reports, including germline and somatic BRCA, HRD_status_overall and hrd_score

**Treatment timeline**:
- **Source**: Chemotherapy order systems (CPOE), infusion center records, pharmacy administration logs, EMR medication administration records
- **Data-sharing requirements**: Exact dates of each chemotherapy/targeted therapy administration; regimen composition (drug names, doses) for identifying platinum, PARPi, ATR, WEE1, etc.; line_of_therapy if recorded; otherwise, full timeline to derive it; structured or text-encoded response assessments (e.g., RECIST reports, radiology impressions) with dates

**CA‑125 series**:
- **Source**: Laboratory information systems (LIS) and EMR lab tables
- **Data-sharing requirements (must explicitly require)**: All CA‑125 values with dates, units, and specimen type; mapping to regimen timeline (link to encounter or visit to infer linked_regimen_id); no suppression of "unnecessary" lab history; full time series is critical

**Molecular / DDR**:
- **Source**: In-house NGS labs (somatic and germline), external panel providers (Foundation, Caris, Myriad, etc.)
- **Data-sharing requirements**: Raw variant tables or structured variant summaries for key DDR genes; HRD assay outputs including scores and statuses, not just "eligible/yes/no"; if available, expression data or RAD51 foci assay results

**Outcomes**:
- **Source**: EMR (problem list, notes, imaging, discharge summaries), tumor registries
- **Data-sharing requirements**: Vital status, death_date, last_followup_date from registry or EMR; radiology report dates with explicit progression annotations or tumor board summaries

---

### 2.3 Data Integration & Join Strategies

**Critical for multi-source data assembly**:

**Join Keys**:
- **Primary key**: `patient_id` (must be consistent across all sources)
- **TCGA barcode format**: Extract patient barcode root (e.g., `TCGA-XX-XXXX`) from full barcode (e.g., `TCGA-XX-XXXX-01A`) for joins
- **cBioPortal patient IDs**: May use same TCGA barcode or study-specific IDs (verify mapping)

**Platinum Drug Name Standardization**:
- **Standard names**: `cisplatin`, `carboplatin`, `oxaliplatin`
- **Common aliases**: `cis-diamminedichloroplatinum`, `CDDP`, `Platinol`, `Paraplatin`, `Eloxatin`
- **Normalization strategy**: Case-insensitive matching, synonym mapping before identification

**Date Alignment**:
- **TCGA index date**: Date of pathologic diagnosis (all `days_to_*` variables are offsets from this)
- **Absolute date conversion**: `regimen_start_date = diagnosis_date + days_to_drug_therapy_start`
- **Date format standardization**: Use ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD) across all sources

**Missing Data Handling**:
- **PFI approximation**: If TCGA-CDR PFI is from diagnosis (not last platinum dose), compute approximate PFI as `pfi_days_tcga_cdr - first_platinum_end_days`
- **Validation**: Flag cases where computed PFI < 0 (data quality issue)

**Sanity Checks**:
- **Patient count validation**: GDC clinical (N~500), TCGA-CDR (N~500), cBioPortal (N~500) should match within 5%
- **Platinum regimen coverage**: ≥70% of patients should have platinum drug records
- **Date consistency**: `regimen_start_date` < `regimen_end_date` < `progression_date` (where applicable)

---

## Part III: Derived Field Computations

### 3.1 PFI (Platinum-Free Interval)

**⚠️ CRITICAL DEFINITION CLARIFICATION**:
- **Schema definition (Section 1.2)**: "time from last platinum dose in a platinum-containing regimen to subsequent progression or relapse event"
- **TCGA-CDR definition**: "time from diagnosis to first progression/recurrence/death" (from diagnosis, not last dose)
- **Resolution for TCGA**: Use TCGA-CDR PFI as approximation, but note it's measured from diagnosis, not last platinum dose

**Computation**:
```
PFI_days = subsequent_relapse_date − last_platinum_dose_date
```

**TCGA approximation** (when last platinum dose date unavailable):
```
approx_PFI_days = pfi_days_tcga_cdr − first_platinum_end_days
```
(Note: This is rough since PFI_CDR is from diagnosis, but usable as first approximation)

**Base fields required (must-have)**:
- `last_platinum_dose_date` (from platinum regimen)
- `subsequent_relapse_date` or `progression_date` defining recurrence

**Categorization**: <6 months, 6–12 months, >12 months for sensitivity/resistance labeling

---

### 3.2 PTPI (Platinum-to-PARPi Interval)

**Definition**: Time from last platinum dose date to start of PARPi regimen.

**Computation**:
```
PTPI_days = parpi_regimen_start_date − last_platinum_dose_date
```

**Base fields required (must-have for PARPi models)**:
- `last_platinum_dose_date` of the prior platinum regimen
- `parpi_regimen_start_date` for the first PARPi regimen

**Note**: PTPI is not fully available in TCGA (no PARPi), but the same machinery will later be reused on real-world cohorts.

---

### 3.3 Treatment-Free Interval

**Definition**: Time between the end of one regimen and start of the next line.

**Computation**:
```
TFI_days = regimen_start_date_(N+1) − regimen_end_date_N
```

**Base fields required**:
- `regimen_end_date` for regimen N
- `regimen_start_date` for regimen N+1

---

### 3.4 PFS and OS

**PFS from index regimen**:
```
PFS_days = min(progression_date, censoring_date) − regimen_start_date
```

**OS from index regimen**:
```
OS_days = min(death_date, last_followup_date) − regimen_start_date
```

**Required fields**:
- `regimen_start_date`, `progression_date` or `censoring_date` (must-have)
- `last_followup_date`

---

### 3.5 DDR_bin

**Concept**: DDR_bin-like variable that binarizes patients into DDR-defective vs DDR-proficient according to cumulative defects across BRCA1/2 and broader DDR genes, HRD scores, and functional assays.

**Base fields** (important but can be simplified for MVP):
- Pathogenic/likely-pathogenic variants in BRCA1/2 and selected DDR genes
- `hrd_status_sample` and `hrd_score_sample`
- `rad51_foci_status` or expression-based DDR activity score where available

**Computation** (MVP simplified):
```
DDR_bin_status = DDR_bin_positive if any of:
  - BRCA1/2 pathogenic (germline or somatic)
  - HRD_positive
  - RAD51 deficient
DDR_bin_negative otherwise
unknown if missing key data
```

**Must-have vs nice-to-have**: PFI, PTPI, treatment-free interval, PFS, OS, and a simple DDR_bin_status are **must-have or strongly recommended**; more elaborate DDR_bin scoring and signature-based refinements are future nice-to-have.

---

## Part IV: KELIM Implementation Strategies

### 4.1 KELIM Concept Summary

**Inputs**: Longitudinal CA‑125 measurements collected during the first ~100 days of platinum-based chemotherapy (frontline or platinum-sensitive relapse), with at least three values including baseline.

**Model**: Population pharmacokinetic-like model where CA‑125 kinetics follow an exponential decline under effective therapy:
```
CA125(t) = CA125_0 · e^(-K·t) + C_min
```
or variant with production term, constrained to nonnegative values.

**Approach**: Nonlinear mixed-effects modeling (e.g., using NONMEM or similar) with standardized patient-level KELIM (K) values.

**Thresholds**: K is standardized and dichotomized into favorable vs unfavorable KELIM based on cutoffs predictive of PFS/OS or complete cytoreduction; e.g., higher KELIM scores associated with improved PFS/OS and higher complete resection odds.

**Constraint**: Because raw KELIM trial datasets with CA‑125 trajectories are not freely downloadable, CrisPRO needs to approximate KELIM using partner data and validation against published patterns rather than direct replication.

---

### 4.2 Strategy A – Own Implementation on Partner Data

**Concept**: Implement a KELIM-like exponential decay model on serial CA‑125 measurements collected in routine care platinum regimens, borrowing published structure and thresholds.

**Data requirements** (at patient-regimen level):
- `regimen_start_date` for platinum regimen (frontline or platinum-sensitive recurrence)
- `baseline_ca125_value` and `baseline_ca125_date` within 14 days before or on `regimen_start_date`
- Serial CA‑125: ≥3 CA‑125 measurements within first 100 days after `regimen_start_date`, including baseline; ≥4–5 preferred for stability; dates and values; ideally aligned with cycle 1–3
- Outcomes: `best_response` and `best_response_date`, `progression_date`, PFS and OS from `regimen_start_date`, and `debulking_status` for surgical outcomes where relevant

**Modeling approach**:
- Fit an exponential (or biexponential if needed) decay model of CA‑125 vs time since `regimen_start_date`, with patient-specific K parameter
- Use nonlinear mixed-effects or hierarchical Bayesian modeling across the cohort to stabilize K estimates, akin to published KELIM modeling
- Standardize K across cohort (mean 0, SD 1) to create `kelim_standardized_score` and categorize into favorable vs unfavorable via published or data-driven thresholds

**Validation approach**:
- **Internal validation**: Assess association of K (continuous and categorical) with PFS and OS hazard ratios (HRs) using Cox models adjusted for known covariates; probability of complete cytoreduction (if surgery present) or best_response (CR/PR vs SD/PD); compare magnitude and direction to published estimates: favorable K associated with HRs around ~0.5–0.6 for PFS/OS vs unfavorable K in several studies
- **External face validity**: Check that patients with high baseline CA‑125 but favorable K have outcomes similar to those with lower baseline but favorable K, supporting K as a chemosensitivity marker rather than static burden

**Key limitations**:
- Real-world CA‑125 schedules may be irregular and sparser than trial datasets, increasing uncertainty in K; some patients may not meet the ≥3 values in 100 days requirement
- Heterogeneous assay labs and timing relative to infusions may introduce noise
- Without direct access to the original population model and covariate structure, K may not be identical to proprietary KELIM but should approximate its behavior

---

### 4.3 Strategy B – External Tools / API Validation

**Concept**: Use publicly available KELIM calculators (e.g., web-based tools like Biomarker Kinetics KELIM calculators used in trials) for a small set of de-identified CA‑125 trajectories to cross-validate CrisPRO's internal K implementation.

**Data requirements**:
- De-identified subset of partner patients with `regimen_start_date` for platinum regimen; baseline and ≥3 CA‑125 values in the first 100 days; age, baseline CA‑125 if required by external calculator
- For external calculators lacking API, manual or semiautomated entry is feasible on a few hundred patients as a validation set

**Validation approach**:
- For each validation patient, compute: internal K estimate (`kelim_k_value`) from CrisPRO's model; external K or KELIM score from the public calculator
- Evaluate: Pearson/Spearman correlation between internal and external K values; concordance in favorable vs unfavorable category assignment (Cohen's kappa); compare their associations with PFS/OS in this subset to ensure similar HRs

**Key limitations**:
- External calculators may implement proprietary standardization or covariate adjustments; direct K values may not be numerically identical
- Limited throughput and potential manual steps; best suited for validation, not routine production
- Calculator terms of use and data transfer/privacy must be respected

### 4.4 Strategy C – Proxy Chemosensitivity Features when K not Computable

**Concept**: When CA‑125 data are too sparse or irregular for robust K modeling, use simpler CA‑125-based proxies to capture early chemosensitivity.

**Proxy features and data requirements**:

**Early percent decline**:
- Compute percent change from baseline to ~cycle 2 or day 21 (using nearest CA‑125):
  ```
  %ΔCA125_21 = 100 · (CA125_day21 − CA125_0) / CA125_0
  ```
- Requires baseline and at least one on-treatment CA‑125 in 21±7 days window

**Time to 50% reduction**:
- Days from `regimen_start_date` to first time CA‑125 ≤50% of baseline
- Requires baseline and serial CA‑125 until 50% threshold reached or censored

**Normalization by cycle 3**:
- Binary: CA‑125 normalized (≤35 U/mL) by ~cycle 3 (e.g., day 63±14 days)
- Requires baseline and at least one CA‑125 measurement around cycle 3

**Integration into models**:
- Use proxy features as separate covariates in outcome models alongside PFI/PTPI and DDR_bin
- When KELIM is available, treat these proxies as complementary; when not, treat them as primary chemosensitivity indicators

**Validation approach**:
- **Internal**: Assess associations of proxies with PFS and OS; expect that greater early decline, faster 50% reduction, and normalization by cycle 3 correlate with improved outcomes, similar to KELIM
- **External alignment**: Compare hazard ratios and predictive performance (e.g., c-index) of these proxies vs KELIM when both available in overlapping patients

**Key limitations**:
- Simpler proxies may be more sensitive to baseline CA‑125 level and measurement noise than model-based K
- Thresholds may require re-calibration per cohort and treatment context
- Cannot fully replicate nuanced kinetic information captured by KELIM's mixed-effects modeling

## Part V: Validation Benchmarks

Each scenario is intended as a data adequacy and sanity check once schema fields are populated. If expected patterns are absent and data quality appears sufficient, that flags model or cohort issues.

### 5.1 Platinum Response Benchmark (PFI/PTPI/KELIM vs Platinum Outcomes)

**Cohort definition**:
- Patients with high-grade serous or similar high-grade epithelial ovarian cancer
- Received frontline platinum-based chemotherapy
- Have at least one subsequent platinum-based regimen in the recurrent setting (platinum re-challenge)
- For a subset, have adequate CA‑125 data to compute K or proxies during frontline

**Required fields**:
- Demographics & baseline: histology, figo_stage, debulking_status, baseline_ca125_value
- Treatment: frontline platinum regimen_start_date, last_platinum_dose_date, best_response, progression_date; subsequent platinum regimen details
- Outcomes: PFS and OS from frontline and from subsequent platinum
- Derived: PFI, PFI categories, KELIM or CA‑125 proxies

**Target relationships/metrics**:
- Verify that longer PFI (>6 or >12 months) is associated with higher response rates and longer PFS to subsequent platinum (HR <1 vs shorter PFI), consistent with Rafii, MITO‑8, and other studies
- In KELIM subset, confirm favorable KELIM is associated with: higher probability of complete resection and improved PFS/OS in frontline, with HRs roughly similar to published (e.g., HR ~0.5–0.6 for favorable vs unfavorable)
- If KELIM not available, ensure CA‑125 proxies (early decline, normalization by cycle 3) show similar directional association with outcomes

---

### 5.2 PARPi Response Benchmark (DDR_bin + PTPI + Prior Lines)

**Cohort definition**:
- Patients with recurrent high-grade serous ovarian cancer who received PARP inhibitor therapy (monotherapy or maintenance)
- Known BRCA1/2 status and HRD_status_sample for most patients
- Prior platinum regimen with available last_platinum_dose_date to compute PTPI

**Required fields**:
- Demographics & baseline: histology, stage, baseline_ca125_value
- Molecular/DDR: BRCA1/2 germline/somatic status, HRD_status_sample, hrd_score_sample, ddr_bin_status
- Treatment: prior platinum regimen timeline, last_platinum_dose_date; PARPi regimen_start_date, line_of_therapy, best_response, progression_date
- Derived: PTPI, number of prior platinum lines, PFS from PARPi start

**Target relationships/metrics**:
- Reproduce expected patterns from PARPi trials and observational data:
  - BRCA-mutated and HRD-positive patients show better PARPi response and longer PFS than BRCA-wildtype/HRD-negative
  - Longer PTPI and fewer prior lines associate with better PARPi outcomes
  - DDR_bin_positive group has enhanced PARPi sensitivity vs DDR_bin_negative, approximating HRs reported for composite DDR markers and PARPi benefit

---

### 5.3 KELIM / CA‑125 Kinetics Benchmark

**Cohort definition**:
- Patients treated with platinum-based frontline or platinum-sensitive recurrent therapy
- Have ≥3 CA‑125 measurements within first 100 days (KELIM-eligible)

**Required fields**:
- CA‑125 series: ca125_measurement_date, ca125_value, linked_regimen_id
- Treatment: regimen_start_date for platinum regimen, best_response, progression_date
- Outcomes: PFS/OS from regimen_start_date
- Derived: kelim_k_value, kelim_category, CA‑125 proxy features

**Target relationships/metrics**:
- Demonstrate that kelim_k_value (continuous) and kelim_category (favorable vs unfavorable) correlate with: higher odds of CR/PR vs SD/PD; longer PFS/OS with HRs in line with published KELIM studies
- In cohorts receiving PARPi maintenance after platinum response, confirm that favorable K associates with longer PARPi PFS, consistent with emerging PARPi + KELIM data
- Use CA‑125 proxies as backup; expect similar directional trends though potentially weaker effect sizes

---

### 5.4 DDR/HRD Biomarker Benchmark

**Cohort definition**:
- Patients with available DDR/HRD measurements and known systemic therapy history (platinum and/or PARPi)

**Required fields**:
- Molecular/DDR: gene-level DDR variants, hrd_status_sample, hrd_score_sample, ddr_bin_status, rad51_foci_status where available
- Treatment: platinum and PARPi regimens, line_of_therapy
- Outcomes: response and PFS from relevant regimens

**Target relationships/metrics**:
- Confirm that HRD-positive / BRCA-mutated / DDR_bin_positive patients:
  - Have improved response to platinum-based chemotherapy and PARPi therapy (higher CR/PR rates)
  - Show longer PFS/OS under DNA-damaging or DDR-targeted therapy, with HR<1 vs HRD-negative
  - If RAD51 foci data present, validate expected relationship: RAD51-deficient status enriches for PARPi sensitivity

---

### 5.5 Data Completeness and Timing Benchmark

**Cohort definition**:
- All ovarian cancer patients in a partner system over a defined time window (e.g., last 5–10 years)

**Required fields**:
- All major schema fields: demographics, baseline tumor info, treatment timeline, CA‑125, DDR, survival

**Target metrics**:
- Proportion of patients with: structured platinum regimens and dates; at least one CA‑125 value during frontline, and ≥3 within first 100 days; known BRCA1/2 and HRD_status_sample; defined progression_date and vital_status

**Thresholds for data sufficiency to proceed**: e.g., ≥60–70% KELIM-eligible among frontline platinum patients, ≥70% BRCA/HRD data for PARPi-treated cohort

---

## Part VI: MVP Prioritization

### 6.1 MVP Must-Have (for initial CrisPRO ovarian deployment)

**Core demographics and baseline**: patient_id, age_at_diagnosis, histology, FIGO stage, debulking_status, diagnosis_date

**Treatment**: detailed regimen records with regimen_start_date, regimen_end_date, regimen_type, line_of_therapy, last_platinum_dose_date, best_response, progression_date

**CA‑125**: baseline_ca125_value/date, serial ca125_measurement_date + ca125_value during frontline platinum; enough density to compute proxies and KELIM-like K in a subset

**DDR**: BRCA1/2 status, HRD_status_overall or hrd_status_sample, basic DDR_bin_status

**Outcomes**: vital_status, death_date or last_followup_date, PFS and OS derived from regimen_start_date and progression/death dates

**Derived**: PFI, PTPI, treatment-free interval

---

### 6.2 Important but Optional (strongly recommended)

- Detailed HRD and LOH scores, mutational signatures, extended DDR panel
- CA‑125 context (linked_regimen_id, ca125_context) to automate regimen linkage
- KELIM-derived fields (kelim_k_value, kelim_standardized_score, kelim_category) once implementation is validated
- RAD51 foci assay results or expression-based DDR pathway scores

---

### 6.3 Future Nice-to-Have

- Detailed dosing schedules, dose intensity, and relative dose intensity metrics
- Imaging-derived volumetric tumor burden or radiomics features
- Patient-reported outcomes and toxicity data to support broader benefit-risk models

---

## Part VII: Step-by-Step Implementation Plans

### 7.1 Concept 1: Platinum Timing + PFI/PTPI from TCGA-OV

**Target**: Build `tcga_ov_platinum_timing.csv` with patient-level platinum dates and PFI

**Status**: Ready for implementation

---

#### 7.1.1 Target Variables for This Concept

**You only need three groups of fields from TCGA-OV**:

**Patient-level survival and index date**:
- `days_to_death`
- `days_to_last_followup`
- `vital_status`
- **Index date for TCGA**: Date of pathologic diagnosis (all `days_to_*` variables are offsets from this)

**Drug-level treatment dates and drugs**:
- `days_to_drug_therapy_start`
- `days_to_drug_therapy_end`
- `drug_name` / `pharmaceutical_therapy_drug_name`
- Optionally `measure_of_response` if present

**Primary therapy outcome / platinum sensitivity surrogates** (from cBioPortal):
- `primary_therapy_outcome_success` (e.g., CR/PR/SD/PD)
- `platinum_status` or equivalent platinum sensitivity variable if exposed

**From these you can compute**:
- `regimen_start_date` / `regimen_end_date` = `diagnosis_date` + `days_to_drug_therapy_start` / `end`
- `last_platinum_dose_date` = max end date of platinum drugs (cisplatin, carboplatin, oxaliplatin)
- **PFI**: Event time from `last_platinum_dose_date` to recurrence/progression – for TCGA, this is approximated by the Pan-Cancer Clinical Data Resource PFI variable, which has already derived PFI from TCGA clinical events
- **PTPI**: Not fully available in TCGA (no PARPi), but the same machinery will later be reused on real-world cohorts

---

#### 7.1.2 Files / Portals to Pull

**From GDC / TCGA-OV**:

**TCGA-OV clinical XML/TSV (drug section)**:
- **Portal**: GDC TCGA-OV project page
- **Content**: Patient, follow-up, drug records including `days_to_drug_therapy_start`, `days_to_drug_therapy_end`, `drug_name`
- **Use either**:
  - Raw XML (and parse `patient.drugs.drug.*` fields) or
  - Preprocessed tables from packages like `curatedTCGAData`, which expose `patient.drugs.drug.N.days_to_drug_therapy_start`, `drug_name`, etc.

**TCGA Pan-Cancer Clinical Data Resource (TCGA-CDR)**:
- **Paper**: "An Integrated TCGA Pan-Cancer Clinical Data Resource" (TCGA-CDR)
- **Supplement**: A standardized clinical file with four endpoints, including PFI (progression-free interval) derived for each case
- **File location**: Available as supplement to the TCGA-CDR paper (typically downloadable from TCGA Research Network or NCI GDC)
- **This file gives you a ready-made PFI variable**, with clear definition/checks:
  - PFI = time from diagnosis to first progression/recurrence/death; validated across TCGA

**Standard survival fields**:
- Same or similar clinical TSV: `days_to_death`, `days_to_last_followup`, `vital_status`, as described in GDC/TCGA workflows

**From cBioPortal TCGA-OV**:
- **Portal**: cBioPortal TCGA-OV study
- **Fields to export**: `PRIMARY_THERAPY_OUTCOME_SUCCESS`, `PLATINUM_STATUS` or similar labels (if present in that build), `OS_MONTHS`, `OS_STATUS`, `PFI_TIME`, `PFI_EVENT` if present as derived variables
- **These help label platinum sensitivity categories and cross-check PFI**

---

#### 7.1.3 Concrete Minimal Dataset to Build

**One table**: `tcga_ov_platinum_timing.csv`

**Row = 1 patient** (TCGA barcode root)

**Columns (for this concept only)**:
- `patient_id` (TCGA barcode)
- `diagnosis_day0` (implicit; 0)
- `first_platinum_start_days` (minimum `days_to_drug_therapy_start` for any platinum drug)
- `first_platinum_end_days` (maximum `days_to_drug_therapy_end` for that course)
- `last_platinum_dose_days` (same as `first_platinum_end_days` for frontline; later extended for multiple lines)
- `vital_status`
- `days_to_death`
- `days_to_last_followup`
- `pfi_days_tcga_cdr` (PFI from TCGA-CDR supplement)
- `pfi_event` (from CDR: 1 = event, 0 = censored)
- `primary_therapy_outcome_success` (from cBioPortal)
- `platinum_status` or similar if available (from cBioPortal)

**You can then derive**:
- `os_days = ifelse(vital_status == "Dead", days_to_death, days_to_last_followup)`
- `approx_platinum_free_interval_days = pfi_days_tcga_cdr - first_platinum_end_days` (rough, since PFI_CDR is from diagnosis, not last dose, but usable as a first approximation)

- File: `TCGA-CDR-SupplementalTableS1.xlsx` or similar (contains PFI, OS, DSS, DFI endpoints)
- Extract: TCGA-OV rows (filter by project = "TCGA-OV")
- Expected: ~500 patients with `PFI_time` and `PFI_event` columns

**Step 3: Download cBioPortal TCGA-OV Clinical Data**

- Fields to extract: `PATIENT_ID`, `PRIMARY_THERAPY_OUTCOME_SUCCESS`, `PLATINUM_STATUS` (if available), `OS_MONTHS`, `OS_STATUS`, `PFI_TIME`, `PFI_EVENT`
- Expected: ~500 patients

**Step 4: Parse GDC Clinical XML/TSV**
- Extract drug therapy records: `patient.drugs.drug.*` sections
- Identify platinum drugs: `cisplatin`, `carboplatin`, `oxaliplatin` (case-insensitive, handle aliases)
- Compute: `first_platinum_start_days = min(days_to_drug_therapy_start)` for all platinum drugs; `first_platinum_end_days = max(days_to_drug_therapy_end)` for all platinum drugs in frontline course
- Join key: Patient barcode root (extract from full barcode, e.g., `TCGA-XX-XXXX-01A` → `TCGA-XX-XXXX`)

**Step 5: Merge All Sources**
- Join on `patient_id` (TCGA barcode root)
- GDC clinical (base) ← TCGA-CDR (PFI) ← cBioPortal (outcomes)
- Validation: All three sources should have ~500 patients; join should preserve ≥95% of patients (some may be missing in one source)

**Step 6: Sanity Checks**
- **Patient count**: All sources should match within 5% (e.g., 475-500 patients)
- **Platinum coverage**: ≥70% of patients should have platinum drug records
- **Date consistency**: `first_platinum_start_days` < `first_platinum_end_days` < `pfi_days_tcga_cdr` (where applicable)
- **PFI validation**: `approx_platinum_free_interval_days` should be ≥0 (if negative, flag as data quality issue)

**Step 7: Export Final Table**
- Output: `tcga_ov_platinum_timing.csv`
- Format: CSV with headers, one row per patient
- Validation: Column count = 12, row count ≈ 500, no missing `patient_id` values
