# Simple Evidence Doctrine (S/P/E) — How Our Evidence Works

## What counts as evidence?
- **S = Sequence signal** (from Evo2): How much the DNA change disrupts sequence likelihood.
- **P = Pathway burden**: Aggregate effect across patient variants on key pathways (e.g., RAS/MAPK, TP53).
- **E = External priors**: ClinVar classification/review + PubMed literature (Diffbot extraction + LLM synthesis).

We combine S/P/E → a tier (“supported / consider / insufficient”) and a confidence.

## Key truths (simple)
- **Single-base variants rarely score big in Evo2**: Small Δ is normal. Don’t chase a big number.
- **Massive synthetic scores are demos, not clinical**:
  - `massive_impact` = 50kb synthetic contrast → big numbers; demo only.
  - `massive_real_context` = real GRCh38 ±25kb → often still small for SNVs.
- **Real decisions come from P and E**: pathway burden across all patient variants + ClinVar/literature gates.

## What the API returns (readable fields)
- `scoring_mode`: `standard_evo` | `massive_real` | `massive_impact`
- `scoring_strategy`: how we measured (window/flank/approach)
- `sequence_details[].impact_level`: no/minor/moderate/major/catastrophic (magnitude label)
- `drugs[].badges`: `PathwayAligned`, `ClinVar-Strong`, `RCT`, `Guideline`
- `drugs[].evidence_manifest`:
  - `pubmed_query`
  - `citations` (pmid, title, publication_types)
  - `clinvar` (classification, review_status)

## How we decide tiers (Evidence Gates)
- **Supported**: RCT/Guideline evidence OR (ClinVar-Strong + PathwayAligned)
- **Consider**: Partial evidence without gates
- **Insufficient**: S < 0.02, P < 0.05, E < 0.2

## How to improve signal (practical)
- **For S (Sequence)**: Adaptive windows [8k, 12k, 16k, 25k, 50k], exon-aligned view, fwd/rev averaging, model ensemble (1B/7B/40B), percentile calibration.
- **For P (Pathway)**: Sum sequence_disruption across all variants before drug weights.
- **For E (Priors/Lit)**: ClinVar classification + review status; PubMed → Diffbot → LLM; cache + show citations.

## Plain-English summary
- Small Evo2 scores for SNVs are expected; use them, don’t overfit them.
- Show how we measured (strategy), label the mode (standard vs massive), and cite evidence (manifest).
- Promote recommendations with gates (pathway + priors/lit), not raw Δ.

## Patentable capabilities (platform co-inventor)
- **Adaptive S/P/E Orchestration**: A configurable pipeline that fuses Evo2 sequence scoring, pathway aggregation, and literature/ClinVar priors with Evidence Gates and confidence calibration. Novel orchestration + calibration can be protectable as a method.
- **Evidence Manifest Layer**: Structured, query-reproducible evidence (citations, claims, priors) tied to every recommendation; supports automated disclosure and co-inventor audit trails.
- **Massive-Mode Labeling and Governance**: Dual-mode scoring with explicit safety labeling (synthetic vs real context) and policy gates to prevent misuse in clinical inference.
- **Percentile Calibration & Gate Design**: Lightweight, disease-configurable percentile mapping and promotion criteria that convert weak S into rigorous, interpretable decisions via P/E.
- **Agentic Literature Synthesis**: PubMed → Diffbot → LLM claims extraction bound to manifest keys, enabling reusable evidence across drugs/variants with caching and TTL.
