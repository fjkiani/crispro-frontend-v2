## 📋 FULL ELIGIBILITY TEXT

### Eligibility Criteria
* There is no age limit for the low risk stratum (stage I ovarian immature teratoma and stage I non-seminoma or seminoma malignant GCT \[all sites\])
* Standard risk 1: Patients must be \< 11 years of age at enrollment
* Standard risk 2: Patients must be \>= 11 and \< 25 years of age at enrollment
* Patients enrolling on one of the low risk arms must be newly diagnosed with a stage I germ cell tumor; for the standard risk arms, patients must be newly diagnosed with malignant germ cell tumor (stage II or higher).

  * Histologic confirmation of a primary extracranial germ cell tumor in any of the categories outlined below is required of all patients at enrollment , with the following exceptions:

    * Among patients were initially diagnosed with completely resected non-seminoma malignant GCT and later recur during observation post surgery, a diagnostic biopsy is not required for enrollment if elevated tumor markers rise to \> 5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) on at least 2 measurements taken at least 1 week apart. The pathology report of initial surgery should be provided
    * Patients may be enrolled without histologic or cytologic confirmation in the rare case where there are exceptionally raised tumor markers (alpha fetoprotein \[AFP- ≥ 500 ng/mL or HCG ≥ 500 IU/L) and radiologic features consistent with GCT. In addition, the treating clinician must deem that the patient's tumor is not suitable for upfront resection and that a biopsy is not in the patient's best interest; or that there is a need to start therapy urgently
* Low risk immature teratoma (IT); site: ovarian; stage: any; grade: any; histology: pure immature teratoma, mixed immature and mature teratoma, (may contain microscopic foci of yolk sac tumor \[\< 3 mm\], but no other pathological evidence of MGCT); tumor markers: alpha-FP =\< 1,000 ng/mL, beta-HCG institutional normal; all ages
* Low risk stage I non-seminoma MGCT; site: ovarian, testicular, or extragonadal; stage: COG stage I, FIGO stage IA and IB, American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) testicular stage IA, IB and IS; histology: must contain at least one of the following: yolk sac tumor, embryonal carcinoma, or choriocarcinoma (pure or mixed); all ages
* Low risk stage I seminoma-MGCT; site: testicular; stage: COG stage I; AJCC testicular stage IA IB, and IS; histology: must contain only seminoma; may contain immature/mature teratoma; may NOT contain yolk sac tumor, embryonal carcinoma, or choriocarcinoma; all ages
* Standard risk 1 (SR1); site: ovarian, testicular, or extragonadal; stage: COG stage II-IV, FIGO stage IC-IV, (International Germ Cell Consensus Classification \[IGCCC\] criteria DO NOT apply); histology: must contain at least one of the following: yolk sac tumor, embryonal carcinoma, or choriocarcinoma; age (years) \< 11
* Standard risk 2 (SR2)

  * Site: ovarian; stage: COG stage II, III, and III-X, FIGO stage IC, II and III; histology: must contain at least one of the following: yolk sac tumor, embryonal carcinoma, or choriocarcinoma; age (years) \>= 11 and \< 25
  * Site: testicular; stage: COG stage II-IV, AJCC stage II, III, IGCCC good risk; histology: must contain at least one of the following: yolk sac tumor, embryonal carcinoma, or choriocarcinoma: must be IGCCC good risk; post op: alpha-FP \< 1,000 ng/mL, beta-HCG \< 5,000 IU/mL and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) \< 3.0 x normal; age (years) \>= 11 and \< 25
* Notes:

  * IGCCC criteria only apply to SR2 patients with a testicular primary tumor
  * Use post-op tumor marker levels to determine IGCCC risk group
  * Pure seminoma patients are not eligible for the standard risk arms of the study
  * For the low risk stage I non-seminoma MGCT and the standard risk arms, components of yolk sac tumor, embryonal carcinoma, or choriocarcinoma can be mixed with other forms of GCT, such as seminoma or mature or immature teratoma; if yolk sac tumor is the only malignant component present, then it must be deemed by the pathologist to be greater than a "microscopic component" of yolk sac tumor
* Patients must have a performance status corresponding to Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scores of 0, 1, 2 or 3; use Karnofsky for patients \> 16 years of age and Lansky for patients =\< 16 years of age
* Organ function requirements apply ONLY to patients who will receive chemotherapy (SR1 and SR2 patients)

* Patients must have had no prior systemic therapy for the current cancer diagnosis
* Patients must have had no prior radiation therapy with the exception of CNS irradiation of brain metastases; (this exception only applies to SR1 patients; any patients over age 11 with distant metastases to brain \[stage IV disease\] would be considered poor risk and therefore not eligible for this trial)
* Patients with significant, pre-existing co-morbid respiratory disease that contraindicate the use of bleomycin are ineligible for the standard risk arms of the trial

## 📊 TRIAL DESCRIPTION

This phase III trial studies how well active surveillance help doctors to monitor subjects with low risk germ cell tumors for recurrence after their tumor is removed. When the germ cell tumor has spread outside of the organ in which it developed, it is considered metastatic. Chemotherapy drugs, such as bleomycin, carboplatin, etoposide, and cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. The trial studies whether carboplatin or cisplatin is the preferred chemotherapy to use in treating metastatic standard risk germ cell tumors.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL GATES FOR AYESHA

✅ No critical biomarker gates identified. Proceed with standard eligibility screening.

---

## ⚔️ TACTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS

**Priority**: 🔥 **P0 - IMMEDIATE ACTION** (Eligibility: ~100%)

**Next Steps**:
1. **Order biomarker tests** (HER2 IHC, HRD if not done)
2. **Contact trial site** (within 48 hours)
3. **Pre-screen Ayesha** (get on coordinator's radar)
4. **Decision at Week 2**: Enroll if eligible
5. **Prepare medical records** (surgical report, pathology, CA-125 history)

**Expected Timeline**:
- Week 1: Complete L1 chemo (cycle 6)
- Week 2: Biomarker results available
- Week 3: Enroll in trial (if eligible) or proceed with SOC maintenance


---

## 🎯 VALUE PROPOSITION

**WIN-WIN SCENARIO**:
- If eligible (100% chance) → Access to experimental therapy
- If not eligible → Gets proven SOC (PARP or bevacizumab maintenance)
- Either way, Ayesha receives appropriate care

**Risk-Benefit**: Low risk (pre-screening doesn't commit to enrollment), high reward (cutting-edge therapy)
