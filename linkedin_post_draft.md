🚀 **Exciting Breakthrough in Cancer Research!**

I'm thrilled to announce that my publication has been accepted by the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) and is now indexed on Google Scholar! This marks a significant milestone for CrisPRO.ai's mission to revolutionize cancer treatment through AI-powered precision medicine.

**Publication Title:** "An agentic platform for designing cancer immunotherapies: From automated variant interpretation to in silico therapeutic validation"

🔬 **What This Means:**
Our research demonstrates how multi-modal foundational AI models can automate the entire drug development workflow - from genomic interpretation and resistance prediction to clinical trial matching and therapeutic validation.

💡 **The Impact:**
- **38x acceleration** in target discovery for pharmaceuticals
- Reducing the current 10-15 year drug development timeline to months
- Bridging the gap between genomic data and clinical application

This represents a paradigm shift in how we approach cancer immunotherapy design, combining cutting-edge AI with real clinical validation to bring life-saving treatments to patients faster.
