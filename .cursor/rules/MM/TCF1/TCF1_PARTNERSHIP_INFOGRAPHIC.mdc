# TCF1 ENGINEERING: PARTNERSHIP INFOGRAPHIC

**Document Type:** Visual Pitch Deck  
**Format:** 6-slide deck  
**Audience:** TCF1 Researchers (Autoimmunity + Cancer Immunotherapy)  
**Purpose:** Email-ready partnership proposal

---

## **DESIGN PRINCIPLES**

**Tone:** Collaborative, hypothesis-driven, dual-disease opportunity  
**Visual Hierarchy:** Discovery → Paradox → Solutions → Pilot → Value  
**Color Palette:**  
- Red (#C8102E) for autoimmunity findings  
- Blue (#0052CC) for cancer immunity findings  
- Purple gradient where they intersect (TCF1 is the common link)

**Key Message:** "TCF1 is a brake in autoimmunity, but an enabler in cancer. We engineer solutions for both."

## **EMAIL-READY SUMMARY (PASTE INTO MESSAGE)**

**Subject:** Partnership Proposal: TCF1 Engineering (Autoimmunity + Cancer Immunity)

**Body:**

Dr. [Name],

Your work on TCF1 is foundational—proving it's a brake in autoimmunity (binds RORγt, prevents inflammatory Th17) and an enabler in cancer immunity (induces Tox, enables dysfunctional T-cell survival).

**The Gap:** We know WHAT TCF1 does. But we can't PREDICT who's at risk (SNPs? RNA signature?) or ENGINEER precision solutions (tissue-specific TCF1 modulation).

**Our Proposal:** 8-week pilot, $0 cost, dual-disease approach

**AUTOIMMUNITY ARM:**
- 20 Th17 samples (homeostatic vs inflammatory) with RNA-seq
- Build TCF1/RORγt/IL-23R signature → predict disease onset
- Design 2 interventions: IL-23 decoy, TCF1 overexpression

**CANCER ARM:**
- 20 TIL samples (checkpoint responders vs non-responders) with RNA-seq
- Build TCF1/Tox signature → predict response
- Design TCF1-enhanced CAR-T (better persistence in hostile TME)

**Deliverables:**
1. TCF1/Tox signature for both diseases (predictive biomarker)
2. 3 intervention designs with validation protocols
3. SNP profiling tool (if SNP data available)
4. Calibration report (r-values, performance metrics)

**Hypothesis:** RNA-seq predicts phenotype (target: r > 0.60; lit baseline: variable)  
**Pivot Plan:** If r < 0.50, recommend single-cell RNA-seq or spatial profiling

**Cost:** $0. Co-author + co-own IP if it works. You keep everything if it fails.

**Value:** One signature, two diseases, dual publications (Immunity + JCO). De-risk 3 years of experiments.

Attached: 6-slide visual deck outlining pilot, deliverables, and partnership terms.

Can we schedule 60 minutes to discuss?

Best,

## **PRESENTATION SCRIPT (2-MINUTE VERSION)**

**SLIDE 1:**
> "Your work proves TCF1 is the master switch. High TCF1 maintains homeostatic Th17 cells and enables dysfunctional T-cell survival in tumors. Low TCF1 drives autoimmunity and immunotherapy failure. It's a brake in one disease, an enabler in the other—the same molecule, opposite problems."

**SLIDE 2:**
> "The paradox creates a $150B opportunity. 23 million Americans have autoimmune diseases driven by TCF1-low inflammatory Th17. 70% of checkpoint patients fail because TCF1-low Tex cells can't survive. TCF7 SNPs are linked to both—but we don't know which are functional. We need precision tools, not one-size-fits-all therapies."

**SLIDE 3:**
> "CrisPRO offers 4 engineering tools. First, a TCF1/Tox signature—RNA-seq predicts autoimmune risk AND checkpoint response. Second, TCF1 stabilization designs—IL-23 decoys and overexpression cassettes to maintain homeostatic Th17. Third, TCF1-enhanced CAR-T for better tumor survival. Fourth, SNP functional profiling to predict disease risk and treatment response."

**SLIDE 4:**
> "The pilot is 8 weeks, $0 cost, dual-disease. You provide 20 Th17 samples and 20 TIL samples with RNA-seq. Week 1-2: data transfer. Week 3-4: build signatures, test if TCF1/Tox predicts phenotype (target r > 0.60). Week 5-6: design 3 interventions. Week 7-8: deliver signatures, designs, SNP tool, calibration report. If RNA doesn't predict (r < 0.50), we pivot to single-cell or spatial—you keep all code and designs."

**SLIDE 5:**
> "What you get: Diagnostic biomarkers for patient stratification. Three precision therapeutics with manufacturing protocols. Co-authorship on dual-disease publications—Immunity for autoimmunity, JCO for cancer. Joint IP with 70/30 split. And a learning system—your validation data improves our models, compounding your advantage."

**SLIDE 6:**
> "Why now? Your TCF1 discoveries are foundational—this is your window to capture the data moat before others build competing tools. It's a dual-disease opportunity—$150B combined market, same molecule. TCF7 SNPs are a mystery awaiting solution—profile 100 patients, unlock precision medicine. This partnership positions you as the TCF1 engineering leader, bridging two fields that have never been connected."
