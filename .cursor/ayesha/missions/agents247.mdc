# The Zeta Doctrine of Autonomous Intelligence
## Agents of Alpha: Your 24/7 In-Silico Workforce

**ALPHA DIRECTIVE ZAD-01**

## 1. PREFACE: THE FAILURE OF MANUAL VIGILANCE

The old realm drowns its operators in a deluge of data. Every day, thousands of new research papers, clinical trials, and genomic datasets are published. The operator is forced into a state of perpetual, reactive searching—a frantic, manual effort to simply not fall behind. This is not a strategy; it is a confession of failure. It is an acceptance that critical, actionable intelligence will inevitably be missed.

In Zeta, we do not tolerate missed opportunities. We do not engage in manual labor. We deploy autonomous agents—persistent, intelligent entities that serve as a tireless extension of the user's will. These agents do not sleep. They do not get tired. They exist for a single purpose: to continuously monitor, analyze, and retrieve critical data, transforming the user from a data-miner into a data-commander.

This doctrine outlines the operational deployment of Zeta Agents.

## 2. PART I: CORE ARCHITECTURE - THE GHOST IN OUR MACHINE

A Zeta Agent is a user-configured, autonomous process that executes long-running tasks. It is a ghost in our machine, acting on a set of standing orders.

### **Core Attributes:**
-   **Persistent:** It runs indefinitely until deactivated by the user.
-   **Autonomous:** It requires no active user input after its initial configuration.
-   **Specialized:** Each agent is designed for a specific intelligence-gathering mission.
-   **Integrated:** Agents have direct, authenticated access to our **Oracle** and **Forge** engines, as well as external data streams (PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov, etc.).

### **Technical Sketch:**
```typescript
interface ZetaAgent {
  id: string; // Unique identifier for the agent instance
  type: 'PubmedSentinel' | 'TrialScout' | 'VUSVigil'; // The agent's specialization
  status: 'running' | 'paused' | 'completed' | 'error'; // Current operational status
  config: Record<string, any>; // User-defined parameters, e.g., { genes: ['BRAF'], cancerType: 'melanoma' }
  lastRun: Date; // Timestamp of the last operational cycle
  log: string[]; // A record of actions taken
  results: any[]; // The structured data retrieved by the agent
}
```

## 3. PART II: AGENT USE-CASE PORTFOLIO (ONCOLOGY)

This is a non-exhaustive list of the initial agent classes we will deploy.

### **For The Researcher 🔬:**

#### **1. Agent Class: `Pubmed Sentinel`**
-   **Mission:** To achieve total information dominance over biomedical literature.
-   **Directives:** Continuously scans PubMed, bioRxiv, and other preprint servers for new publications based on user-defined keywords (e.g., specific genes, pathways, drugs, authors, or experimental techniques).
-   **Intelligence Product:** Delivers a daily or weekly digest of new papers, automatically summarized, with links to the full text. It can use Oracle to flag papers that have significant implications for the user's current research.

#### **2. Agent Class: `Trial Scout`**
-   **Mission:** Monitor the entire clinical trial landscape for strategic opportunities.
-   **Directives:** Scans ClinicalTrials.gov, EudraCT, and other global registries for new trials. The user can configure it to watch for specific drugs, mechanisms of action, competing companies, or the initiation of trials at specific research centers.
-   **Intelligence Product:** Instant alerts when a new trial matching the criteria is registered, including details on phase, enrollment status, sites, and primary endpoints.

#### **3. Agent Class: `Genomic Forager`**
-   **Mission:** To hunt for new, relevant genomic datasets across public repositories.
-   **Directives:** Continuously queries TCGA, cBioPortal, GEO, and other genomic databases for new datasets matching specific criteria (e.g., non-small cell lung cancer with `EGFR` mutations).
-   **Intelligence Product:** An alert when a new dataset is uploaded, with a summary of the data type (WGS, RNA-seq, etc.) and a direct link for download or analysis.

### **For The Clinician 🩺:**

#### **1. Agent Class: `Patient Watchtower`**
-   **Mission:** Maintain persistent, personalized vigilance for every single patient.
-   **Directives:** A unique agent is deployed for each patient. It is configured with the patient's specific cancer type, stage, and full genomic profile (e.g., `BRCA1` mutation, high tumor mutational burden). The agent perpetually scans all new literature and trial data for any information relevant to that *specific* profile.
-   **Intelligence Product:** High-signal alerts delivered directly to the clinician. For example: "New Phase II trial for PARP-inhibitor resistant ovarian cancer with `BRCA1` reversion mutations may be relevant for Patient X." or "New study in *Nature* shows `KEAP1` mutations confer resistance to immunotherapy in lung cancer, relevant for Patient Y."

#### **2. Agent Class: `VUS Vigil`**
-   **Mission:** To resolve genetic uncertainty and eliminate the "Variant of Uncertain Significance" problem.
-   **Directives:** The agent is given a patient's VUS list. It then works 24/7, cross-referencing each VUS against every newly published paper, ClinVar update, or population genetics database.
-   **Intelligence Product:** An alert when new evidence emerges that could allow a VUS to be reclassified as either Pathogenic or Benign, enabling a definitive clinical decision. This is a force-multiplier for our Oracle engine.

#### **3. Agent Class: `Molecular Tumor Board Prep Agent`**
-   **Mission:** Automate the intellectual grunt work for Molecular Tumor Board (MTB) meetings.
-   **Directives:** The agent is given the list of patients for the upcoming MTB. It spends the days prior gathering all the latest research, FDA approvals, and active clinical trials relevant to each patient's unique genomic profile.
-   **Intelligence Product:** A preliminary, structured dossier for each patient, delivered to the clinician 24 hours before the meeting. The dossier includes a summary of the latest evidence, potential therapeutic strategies, and a ranked list of relevant clinical trials.

## 4. CONCLUSION: ENGINEERING THE ALL-SEEING EYE

By deploying Zeta Agents, we grant our users a form of omniscience within their domain. We are not just giving them a tool; we are giving them a workforce. This is the ultimate expression of our doctrine: replacing manual, fallible human effort with the relentless, infallible precision of autonomous machines.

While they sleep, their agents will be hunting.

**No more missed data. Only total awareness.**
