[ 5 ] - Case Report Forms (CRF) for toxicities Grade 3-5. b) Frequency of serious FP-related toxicity in DPYD variant carrier patientsreceiving FP chemotherapies: - Using same metrics as above. Develop and implement strategies to address enablers and barriers identified in the feasibility study. Using validated framework and including patient and clinician interviews [ 29 , 30 ] Determine cost-effectiveness of upfront DPYD genotyping and personalised dosing and estimate healthcare benefits of full implementation of DPYD PGx -guided dose-adjustment in an Australian population. a) Health economic and cost-effectiveness analysis of upfront DPYD screening and PGx-guided dose-adjustments / individualisation. b) Apply health economic modelling to illustrate cost burden and cost-effectiveness of pre-emptive DPYD screening on health care services. Secondary Objectives Determine feasibility of PGx screening and dose-adjustment. a) Feasibility of DPYD genotyping and utility of dose recommendation guidelines: - TAT for genotyping. - Proportion of variant allele carriers who undergo dose-adjustment. Identification and exploration of adherence / deviations from dose-adjustment guidelines. Confirm prevalence of clinically significant DPYD variants within the Australian community. Measure frequency of each of the 4 DPYD variants c.1905+1G>A (rs3918290), c.2846A>T (rs67376798), c.1679T>G (rs55886062) and c.1236G>A (rs56038477). Deliver a scientifically sound PGx protocol for pre-treatment genotyping that can be adopted into pathology laboratories across Australia. Evaluate effectiveness of implementation research strategies using validated framework [ 29 , 30 ] [ 29 , 30 ] Determine cancer outcomes for DPYD variant carriers with dose-adjusted FP compared to current standard of care. Measure long-term outcomes including disease-free survival (DFS), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) Tertiary / Translational Objectives a Identify UGT1A1 variants ( *6 , *28 and *37 ) in patients receiving irinotecan and explore feasibility of expansion of a PGx panel to include UGT1A1 genotyping. Determine UGT1A1 variant allele frequency and establish feasibility of genotyping pathway. Explore other factors contributing to severe toxicity in patients not carrying the aforementioned DPYD variant alleles. a) Consider genomic polymorphisms, within the DPYD gene or elsewhere, other downstream regulators and enzymes along the FP metabolic pathway to formulate translational investigations. b) Evaluation of DPD enzyme activity in selected cases: - Confirm that genotype correlates with phenotype measures (UH2/U concentration ratio, pharmacokinetics) CTCAE Common terminology criteria for adverse events, DFS Disease-free survival, DPYD Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (gene), FP Fluoropyrimidine, OS Overall survival, PFS Progression-free survival, PGx Pharmacogenomic, TAT Turn-around time, UGT1A1 Uridine-diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase family 1 a Translational endpoints only partially covered by current funding"
