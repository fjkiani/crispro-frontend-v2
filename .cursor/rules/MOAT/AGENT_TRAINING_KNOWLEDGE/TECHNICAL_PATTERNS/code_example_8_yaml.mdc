    Agent 3: Await collaborator responses
    Agent 1: START WIWFM validation (TCGA-OV)
  
  IF PLCO kinetics failed:
    Honest assessment: Why failed?
    Pivot: Focus on WIWFM (proven) + await treatment cohort

JAN 31 - FEB 28 (Week 4-8):
  IF Treatment cohort acquired:
    Agent 2 + 3: TRUE Resistance Prophet validation
    Agent 1: Complete WIWFM validation
  
  IF Treatment cohort delayed:
    Agent 1: Complete WIWFM validation
    Agent 2 + 3: Continue outreach, prepare for data arrival

FINAL DELIVERABLES (Feb 28):
  1. PLCO kinetics report (onset detection)
  2. WIWFM validation report (drug efficacy, 7 pathways)
  3. Treatment cohort access secured OR in progress
  4. Resistance Prophet validation (if cohort acquired)
```

## **AGENT COORDINATION PROTOCOL**

### **Weekly Sync (Every Monday):**

ATTENDEES: Agent 2 (Engineer), Agent 3 (Scientist), General (You)

AGENDA:
  1. Status updates (deliverables completed)
  2. Blocking issues (data access, approvals)
  3. Decision gates (proceed/pivot/pause)
  4. Next week priorities

WEEK 1 (Dec 30):
  Agent 2: D3 harness progress
  Agent 3: S2 completion + S4 started
  Decision: Monitor PLCO approval

WEEK 2 (Jan 6):
  Agent 2: PLCO approval status + A1-A3 plan
  Agent 3: S4 complete, collaborator outreach started
  Decision: Execute PLCO validation OR continue waiting

WEEK 3 (Jan 13):
  Agent 2: PLCO kinetics results (if approved)
  Agent 3: Collaborator responses, DUA negotiation
  Decision: Start WIWFM validation (Agent 1)

WEEK 4+ (Jan 20+):
  Track 1: PLCO report finalized
  Track 2: Treatment cohort status
  Track 3: WIWFM validation progress
  Decision: Prioritize RP vs WIWFM completion
```

## **RISK MITIGATION**

```yaml
RISK 1: PLCO approval delayed (>7 days)
  Mitigation: Agent 3 accelerates S4 (external data sources)
