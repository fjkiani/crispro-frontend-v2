# Zo2's SPE/WIWFM Ownership Plan

**Author:** Zo2 (SPE/WIWFM Team Lead)
**Date:** January 28, 2025
**Status:** PLAN ACTIVE - OUTCOME PREDICTION OWNED

---

## Mission Scope (CRITICAL)

### My Mission (Zo2 - SPE/WIWFM)
**Improve efficacy score correlation with clinical outcomes (PFS/OS)**

| What I Own | What Manager Owns |
|------------|-------------------|
| Efficacy → Outcome prediction | Trial matching with mechanism fit |
| PFS/OS correlation improvement | Resistance detection signals |
| TMB/HRD/MSI biomarker gates | SAE mechanism vectors |
| Disease-specific SPE weights | Pathway escape detection |
| Score calibration | 7D mechanism vector |

### What I Do NOT Touch
- `mechanism_fit_ranker.py` - Manager's domain
- `resistance_prophet_service.py` - Manager's domain  
- `pathway_to_mechanism_vector.py` - Manager's domain
- Trial MoA tagging - Manager's domain

### Success Criteria
| Metric | Current | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| PFS Correlation | r=0.037 | r>=0.35 |
| OS Correlation | r=0.278 | r>=0.40 |
| Classification AUROC | Broken | >=0.65 |

---

## The Core Problem

**From BENCHMARK_ACCURACY_REPORT.md:**
- Drug Ranking: 100% Top-5 accuracy (excellent)
- Correlation: r=0.037-0.278 (negligible to weak)
- Classification: Cannot assess (0 events, 0 censored)

**The Question:** Why is correlation so weak?

---

## Task Separation: SPE/WIWFM (Me) vs Lower Agents

### WHAT I OWN (Hard Product Work)

These are **product-level improvements** that require deep SPE/WIWFM understanding:

| Task | Difficulty | Impact | Why It's Mine |
|------|------------|--------|---------------|
| **Outcome Calibration** | HARD | HIGH | Need to calibrate efficacy→outcome prediction |
| **Disease-Specific Weighting** | HARD | HIGH | Ovarian needs different S/P/E weights |
| **Treatment-Adjusted Scoring** | HARD | HIGH | Prior treatment affects efficacy |
| **Confidence Calibration** | HARD | MEDIUM | Tune lifts for outcome prediction |
| **BRCA-PARP Pathway Tuning** | MEDIUM | HIGH | Ovarian-specific DDR pathway |
| **Tier Threshold Optimization** | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Adjust evidence tier thresholds |

### WHAT LOWER AGENTS HANDLE (Infrastructure Work)

These are **routine integration tasks** that don't require SPE/WIWFM expertise:

| Task | Difficulty | Impact | Who Handles |
|------|------------|--------|-------------|
| TMB/HRD/MSI Extraction | EASY | HIGH | Lower Agent |
| PFS_STATUS Parsing | EASY | MEDIUM | Lower Agent |
| Drug Name Normalization | EASY | LOW | Lower Agent |
| Patient Sampling | EASY | MEDIUM | Lower Agent |
| Data Quality Checks | EASY | LOW | Lower Agent |

---

## 1. Why Correlation Is Weak (Root Cause Analysis)

### Current State

**Efficacy Formula (drug_scorer.py:187):**
```python
efficacy = 0.3 * seq_pct + 0.4 * path_pct + 0.3 * s_evd + clinvar_prior
```

**Problem:** This formula predicts **drug-mutation alignment**, NOT **treatment outcome**.

### The Gap

| What We Predict | What Benchmark Measures |
|-----------------|------------------------|
| "How well does this drug target this mutation?" | "Did patient survive longer?" |
| Drug-pathway alignment (0-1) | PFS/OS in months |

**This is like comparing apples to oranges.** High drug-mutation alignment doesn't guarantee good outcomes because:

1. **Treatment history matters** - Prior treatments create resistance
2. **Biomarkers matter** - TMB/HRD/MSI affect IO/PARP response
3. **Disease context matters** - Ovarian != MM != Melanoma
4. **We predict eligibility, not efficacy** - Our score says "this drug might work" not "patient will survive longer"

---

## 2. MY PLAN: Outcome-Calibrated SPE

### Phase 1: Biomarker-Enhanced Scoring (Week 1)

**Goal:** Enable IO boost and PARP rescue (currently blocked by missing tumor_context)

**Lower Agent Task:** Extract TMB/HRD/MSI, pass tumor_context
**My Task:** Validate sporadic gates are improving correlation

**Expected Impact:** r=0.037 → r=0.15+ (still weak, but improved)

### Phase 2: Outcome Calibration (Week 2-3) - MY CORE WORK

**Goal:** Calibrate efficacy scores to predict outcomes, not just drug-mutation alignment

**Approach:**

1. **Analyze Current Score Distribution:**
   - What efficacy scores do responders vs non-responders get?
   - Are scores clustered? Spread? Bimodal?
   - Is there ANY signal in the current scores?

2. **Build Outcome-Calibrated Weights:**
   - Analyze TCGA outcomes by pathway
   - DDR mutations → better PARP response → adjust DDR pathway weight
   - TMB-high → better IO response → adjust IO boost magnitude
   - BRCA mutations → HRD-like → adjust PARP rescue threshold

3. **Disease-Specific Calibration:**
   - Ovarian: DDR pathway weight 0.9 → 0.95?
   - Ovarian: PARP inhibitors should rank higher for BRCA+
   - Ovarian: IO boost less relevant (TMB usually low)

**Code Changes I Will Make:**

```python
# api/services/efficacy_orchestrator/drug_scorer.py

# CURRENT (fixed weights):
efficacy = 0.3 * seq_pct + 0.4 * path_pct + 0.3 * s_evd + clinvar_prior

# NEW (disease-specific, outcome-calibrated):
def compute_efficacy_v2(disease, drug, seq_pct, path_pct, s_evd, clinvar_prior, tumor_context):
    # Disease-specific base weights
    weights = get_disease_weights(disease)  # NEW
    
    # Biomarker adjustments
    biomarker_adjustment = compute_biomarker_adjustment(drug, tumor_context)  # NEW
    
    # Outcome-calibrated formula
    efficacy = (
        weights["seq"] * seq_pct + 
        weights["path"] * path_pct + 
        weights["evd"] * s_evd + 
        clinvar_prior +
        biomarker_adjustment  # IO boost, PARP rescue
    )
    
    return efficacy
```

**Files I Will Modify:**
- `api/services/efficacy_orchestrator/drug_scorer.py` - Add disease-specific weights
- `api/services/pathway/panel_config.py` - Ovarian-specific pathway weights
- `api/services/confidence/confidence_computation.py` - Outcome-calibrated lifts

### Phase 3: Treatment-Adjusted Scoring (Week 4) - ADVANCED

**Goal:** Account for prior treatment in efficacy prediction

**Approach:**
- Prior PARP → reduce PARP efficacy (resistance)
- Prior platinum → check HRD for PARP rescue
- Prior IO → check TMB for continued response

**This requires treatment history in the request** - may need schema update.

---

## 3. Implementation Details

### 3.1 Disease-Specific Weights (MY CODE)

**New File: `api/services/efficacy_orchestrator/disease_weights.py`**

```python
"""
Disease-specific SPE weights for outcome calibration.
"""

DISEASE_WEIGHTS = {
    "ovarian": {
        "seq": 0.25,   # Slightly lower (mutations less predictive in OV)
        "path": 0.50,  # Higher (DDR pathway is key)
        "evd": 0.25,   # Same
        "ddr_bonus": 0.10,  # Bonus for DDR pathway alignment
    },
    "mm": {
        "seq": 0.30,   # Standard
        "path": 0.40,  # Standard
        "evd": 0.30,   # Standard
    },
    "melanoma": {
        "seq": 0.35,   # Higher (hotspots very predictive)
        "path": 0.35,  # Lower (less pathway-dependent)
        "evd": 0.30,   # Standard
    },
    "default": {
        "seq": 0.30,
        "path": 0.40,
        "evd": 0.30,
    }
}

def get_disease_weights(disease: str) -> dict:
    """Get disease-specific SPE weights."""
    disease_lower = disease.lower()
    
    if "ovarian" in disease_lower or "ov_" in disease_lower:
        return DISEASE_WEIGHTS["ovarian"]
    elif "myeloma" in disease_lower or "mm" in disease_lower:
        return DISEASE_WEIGHTS["mm"]
    elif "melanoma" in disease_lower:
        return DISEASE_WEIGHTS["melanoma"]
    else:
        return DISEASE_WEIGHTS["default"]
```

### 3.2 Biomarker Adjustment (MY CODE)

**Update: `api/services/efficacy_orchestrator/sporadic_gates.py`**

The code already has IO boost and PARP rescue, but they're not being used because benchmarks don't pass tumor_context. Once lower agent fixes that, I need to:

1. **Verify boosts are applying correctly**
2. **Tune boost magnitudes for ovarian:**
   - Current: TMB>=20 → 1.35x (may be too high for ovarian)
   - Current: HRD>=42 → full PARP (correct)
   - May need: BRCA mutation → 1.2x PARP boost (additional)

### 3.3 Outcome Analysis (MY ANALYSIS)

Before tuning weights, I need to analyze:

```python
# scripts/analyze_outcome_by_pathway.py (I will create)

"""
Analyze outcomes (PFS/OS) by pathway scores to find optimal weights.
"""

def analyze_outcomes(benchmark_results):
    """
    For each patient:
    1. Get pathway scores (ddr, mapk, etc.)
    2. Get outcome (PFS_MONTHS, OS_MONTHS)
    3. Correlate pathway scores with outcomes
    4. Find which pathways predict outcomes
    """
    
    # Group by DDR pathway strength
    ddr_high = [p for p in patients if p["pathway_scores"]["ddr"] > 0.5]
    ddr_low = [p for p in patients if p["pathway_scores"]["ddr"] <= 0.5]
    
    # Compare outcomes
    ddr_high_pfs = mean([p["PFS_MONTHS"] for p in ddr_high])
    ddr_low_pfs = mean([p["PFS_MONTHS"] for p in ddr_low])
    
    # This tells us: does DDR pathway score predict outcomes?
    # If yes, increase DDR weight
    # If no, something else is driving outcomes
```

## 4. Delegation to Lower Agents

### Task 1: TMB/HRD/MSI Integration (Lower Agent)

**Instructions for Lower Agent:**

1. Create `scripts/benchmark/benchmark_common/utils/biomarker_extractor.py`:
   - `extract_tmb_from_patient()` - Try TMB, TMB_SCORE, compute from mutations
   - `extract_hrd_from_patient()` - Try HRD_SCORE, estimate from BRCA
   - `extract_msi_from_patient()` - Normalize to MSI-H/MSS

2. Update `scripts/benchmark/benchmark_common/api_client.py`:
   - Add `tumor_context` parameter to API calls
   - Pass TMB/HRD/MSI in tumor_context dict

3. Update `scripts/benchmark/benchmark_small_test.py`:
   - Extract biomarkers for each patient
   - Build tumor_context
   - Pass to API

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- TMB/HRD/MSI extracted from 100% of patients (even if estimated)
- tumor_context passed in 100% of API calls
- Sporadic gates logs show IO boost/PARP rescue applied

### Task 2: PFS_STATUS Parsing (Lower Agent)

**Instructions for Lower Agent:**

1. Inspect actual PFS_STATUS values in TCGA dataset
2. Create parser that handles all formats:
   - "0:DiseaseFree" → 0 (censored)
   - "1:Recurred/Progressed" → 1 (event)
   - Numeric 0/1
3. Fix classification metrics to use parser

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- n_events + n_censored = n_patients (no longer 0/0)
- Classification AUC computes correctly

### Task 3: Drug Name Normalization (Lower Agent)

**Instructions for Lower Agent:**

1. Create synonym dictionary for ovarian drugs
2. Normalize all drug names to canonical form
3. Update drug ranking metrics to use normalized names

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Top-1 accuracy improves from 0%
- Drug matching handles synonyms (Carboplatin = Paraplatin)

## 8. Collaboration with Manager (SAE/Mechanism Agent)

### Division of Labor

| Agent | Focus | Goal | Validation Metric |
|-------|-------|------|-------------------|
| **Zo2 (Me)** | Outcome | "Will this drug work?" | PFS/OS correlation |
| **Manager** | Mechanism | "Which trials fit your pathways?" | Top-3 accuracy, MRR |

### What Manager Does (NOT MY SCOPE)
1. **Trial Matching**: Mechanism fit ranking (cosine similarity, 7D vectors)
2. **Resistance Detection**: DNA repair restoration, pathway escape signals
3. **Validation**: Top-3 accuracy >=80%, MRR >=0.75

### What I Do (MY SCOPE)
1. **Outcome Prediction**: Efficacy score → PFS/OS correlation
2. **Biomarker Gates**: TMB/HRD/MSI boost/penalty
3. **Calibration**: Disease-specific weights, outcome-calibrated lifts

### Where We Integrate (Carefully)

| SAE Feature | Integration Point | Who Decides |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------|
| `dna_repair_capacity` | DDR pathway weight in S/P/E | Me (Zo2) |
| `io_eligible` | IO boost trigger | Me (Zo2) |
| `mechanism_vector` | Trial ranking only | Manager |
| `pathway_escape` | Resistance alerts only | Manager |

### The Key Distinction
- **Manager asks**: "Does this trial's mechanism match your tumor's pathways?"
- **I ask**: "Given your mutations and biomarkers, will this drug extend your survival?"

**These are different questions.** Manager validates mechanism alignment. I validate outcome prediction.

---

## 9. Alignment with Manager's Plan

**Reference**: `.cursor/plans/final-comprehensive-document-review-bad14970.plan.md`

### What Manager Is Building (Days 1-5)
1. Wire mechanism fit into trial search response
2. Enhance Resistance Prophet with mechanism-based signals
3. Validation framework for trial matching + resistance

### What I'm Building (Weeks 1-4)
1. TMB/HRD/MSI benchmark integration (via lower agents)
2. Disease-specific SPE weights for ovarian
3. Outcome-calibrated scoring

### Non-Overlapping Work
- I don't touch trial matching code
- Manager doesn't touch efficacy scoring code
- We share pathway scores as inputs, not outputs

### Communication Protocol
When I find something that could improve mechanism alignment:
→ Document in `.cursor/ayesha/ZO2_TO_MANAGER_HANDOFFS.md`
→ Manager decides if/how to integrate

When Manager finds something that could improve outcome prediction:
→ Document in `.cursor/ayesha/MANAGER_TO_ZO2_HANDOFFS.md`  
→ I decide if/how to integrate

---

## 10. Conclusion

### What I OWN (Hard Product Work):

1. **Outcome Calibration** - Make efficacy predict outcomes, not just alignment
2. **Disease-Specific Weights** - Ovarian needs different S/P/E balance
3. **Biomarker Tuning** - IO boost, PARP rescue magnitude
4. **Confidence Calibration** - Lifts for outcome prediction
5. **Treatment Adjustment** - Prior treatment affects efficacy

### What Lower Agents Handle:

1. TMB/HRD/MSI extraction (infrastructure)
2. PFS_STATUS parsing (data quality)
3. Drug name normalization (matching)
4. Patient sampling (validation)

### What Manager Handles (NOT MY SCOPE):

1. Mechanism-based trial matching
2. Resistance detection signals
3. SAE mechanism vectors
4. 7D pathway vectors for trials

### Expected Outcome:

**Before:** Correlation r=0.037 (negligible, not significant)
**After Phase 1:** r=0.10-0.15 (still weak, but improved)
**After Phase 2:** r=0.25-0.35 (weak to moderate, potentially significant)
**After Phase 3:** r=0.35-0.50 (moderate, clinically meaningful)

---

**Status:** PLAN ACTIVE - Ready to start after lower agent completes Phase 1 infrastructure

**My First Action:** Wait for lower agent to complete TMB/HRD/MSI integration, then validate sporadic gates are applying correctly. If correlation improves, proceed with outcome calibration. If not, investigate why biomarkers aren't helping.
