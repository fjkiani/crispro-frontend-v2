## **3.1 THE 85-90% REALITY**

### **Prevalence Statistics**:

| Cancer Type | Sporadic % | Hereditary % |
|-------------|------------|--------------|
| **Ovarian** | 85-90% | 10-15% |
| **Breast** | 90-95% | 5-10% |
| **Colorectal** | 95% | 5% (Lynch) |
| **Prostate** | 70% | 30% |

**Total Market Impact**: **85-90% of all cancer patients are sporadic** (not germline-positive)

### **Why This Matters**:

1. **Market Size**: 
   - Most platforms focus on hereditary (10-15% of market)
   - We address sporadic (85-90% of market)
   - **5.6x larger addressable market**

2. **Clinical Reality**:
   - Most patients test **germline negative**
   - Germline testing alone is **insufficient** for treatment decisions
   - Tumor genomics becomes **CRITICAL** for therapy selection

3. **Competitive Advantage**:
   - Most platforms ignore sporadic cancers
   - We provide **tumor-centric analysis** for the majority
   - **Differentiation**: Sporadic-first approach

## **3.2 PARADIGM SHIFT: GERMLINE → TUMOR**

### **What Changes When Germline Negative**:

| **Germline-Centric** | **Tumor-Centric (Sporadic)** |
|----------------------|------------------------------|
| Family history screening | Tumor NGS panel |
| Inherited mutation counseling | Somatic mutation profiling |
| Predictable pathway disruption | Complex multi-hit evolution |
| PARP inhibitors (BRCA) | Pathway-agnostic therapies |
| Preventive surgery for family | Tumor-based trial matching |

### **Platform Shift**:

**From**: Germline variant analysis  
**To**: Tumor somatic variant + TMB/MSI/HRD + treatment lines

**Impact**: Complete re-architecture of S/P/E scoring:
- **Sequence (S)**: Score **somatic mutations** (not germline)
- **Pathway (P)**: Aggregate **multi-hit disruptions** across pathways
- **Evidence (E)**: Prefer **tumor-based literature** (somatic trials)
- **SAE Features**: Extract **tumor-specific features** (TMB, MSI, HRD)

---

## **3.3 CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS**

### **Positive Aspects**:
- ✅ **Better prognosis** (no germline "second hit" vulnerability)
- ✅ **Lower family risk** (population-level only, not elevated)

### **Challenges**:
- ⚠️ **Standard hereditary-targeted therapies less effective** (PARP in non-BRCA)
- 🎯 **Tumor genomics CRITICAL** for therapy selection
- ⚠️ **Treatment line intelligence critical** (cross-resistance complex in sporadic)
- 🎯 **Clinical trial matching** (somatic biomarker trials expanding)

---

## **3.4 STRATEGIC VALUE**

### **Why This Matters**:

1. **85-90% of cancers are sporadic** → vast majority need tumor-centric analysis
2. **Germline testing alone insufficient** → most patients test negative
3. **Treatment line intelligence critical** → cross-resistance complex in sporadic
4. **Clinical trial matching** → somatic biomarker trials expanding

### **Competitive Advantage**:

- **Most platforms focus on hereditary** (10-15% of market)
- **We address sporadic** (85-90% of market) with:
  - Tumor NGS + treatment lines
  - Somatic biomarker matching
  - Sporadic-aware trial filtering
  - PARP rescue logic (HRD ≥42)

**Market Expansion**: 5.6x larger addressable market

## **3.5 KEY CONCEPTS**

### **Sporadic vs Hereditary**:

**Sporadic Cancer**:
- No pathogenic germline mutations detected
- Cancer arises from **somatic (acquired) mutations** in tumor tissue only
- **NOT inherited** - family members at population-level risk only
- **85-90% of all cancers**

**Hereditary Cancer**:
- Pathogenic germline mutations detected (BRCA1/2, Lynch, etc.)
- Cancer arises from **inherited mutations** + somatic "second hit"
- **Inherited** - family members at elevated risk
- **10-15% of all cancers**

### **Tumor NGS**:

**What It Is**:
- Next-generation sequencing of **tumor tissue** (not blood/germline)
- Identifies **somatic mutations** (acquired in tumor)
- Provides **TMB, MSI, HRD scores** (tumor-specific biomarkers)

**Key Metrics**:
- **TMB** (Tumor Mutational Burden): mutations/megabase
- **MSI** (Microsatellite Instability): MSI-high/MSS
- **HRD** (Homologous Recombination Deficiency): 0-100 score (somatic)

### **Somatic Mutations**:

**Definition**: Mutations acquired in tumor tissue (not inherited)

**Examples**:
- TP53 R248Q (tumor suppressor loss)
- KRAS G12D (oncogene activation)
- Somatic HRD (DNA repair deficiency)

**Key Difference**: Somatic mutations are **acquired**, not inherited

### **Germline Status**:

**Values**: "positive" | "negative" | "unknown"

**Clinical Impact**:
- **Positive**: Hereditary cancer → PARP inhibitors effective
- **Negative**: Sporadic cancer → PARP less effective (unless HRD ≥42)
- **Unknown**: Conservative approach → PARP penalty (0.8x)

## **3.6 AYESHA CASE STUDY CONTEXT**

### **Ayesha's Germline Testing (June 2023)**:
- **Test**: Ambry CustomNext-Cancer® +RNAinsight® (38 genes)
- **Result**: **NEGATIVE** - No pathogenic mutations, no VUS, no deletions/duplications
- **Genes tested**: BRCA1/2, Lynch (MLH1/MSH2/MSH6/PMS2), APC, TP53, ATM, PALB2, RAD51C/D, CHEK2, and 26 others

### **What This Means for Ayesha**:
- ✅ **Sporadic cancer** - not hereditary (85-90% of ovarian cancers are sporadic)
- ✅ **Family members** - population-level risk only (not elevated)
- ⚠️ **PARP inhibitors** - less effective without germline BRCA (unless somatic HRD high)
- 🎯 **Tumor NGS CRITICAL** - need to find somatic drivers (TP53 likely, possibly somatic HRD, KRAS, PIK3CA)

### **Strategic Value for Ayesha's Oncologist**:

**Before Sporadic Capabilities**:
- ❌ Germline negative → "No hereditary mutations found" → dead end
- ❌ PARP inhibitors recommended anyway (based only on ovarian cancer type)
- ❌ No way to know if somatic HRD present
- ❌ Clinical trials show "BRCA-required" trials → wastes time

**After Sporadic Capabilities**:
- ✅ Germline negative → "Sporadic cancer, analyze tumor genomics" → clear path
- ✅ PARP inhibitors **penalized** unless somatic HRD high → honest assessment
- ✅ Somatic HRD (52) → PARP combo **lifted** with rationale
- ✅ Clinical trials **filtered** to exclude BRCA-required → save time
- ✅ Complete audit trail: germline + tumor + treatment history → transparent decision

## **3.7 COMPETITIVE POSITIONING**

### **Market Landscape**:

**Most Platforms**:
- Focus on hereditary cancers (10-15% of market)
- Germline-centric analysis
- PARP inhibitors for BRCA-positive only
- Limited tumor NGS support

**Our Platform**:
- Focus on sporadic cancers (85-90% of market)
- Tumor-centric analysis
- PARP rescue logic (HRD ≥42 for sporadic)
- Complete tumor NGS integration

### **Differentiation**:

1. **Sporadic-First Approach**: We address the majority (85-90%), not the minority (10-15%)
2. **Tumor NGS Integration**: Complete support for Foundation/Tempus reports
3. **PARP Rescue Logic**: HRD ≥42 rescues PARP for germline-negative patients
4. **Sporadic-Aware Trial Matching**: Filters out germline-required trials
5. **Treatment Line Intelligence**: Cross-resistance mapping for sporadic cases

## **3.8 FOUNDATION FOR TECHNICAL WORK**

### **How This Informs Technical Decisions**:

1. **Why PARP Rescue Matters**:
   - 85-90% of patients are germline negative
   - Without rescue logic, PARP would be penalized for all sporadic cases
   - HRD ≥42 enables PARP for sporadic patients (clinical evidence)

2. **Why IO Boost Exists**:
   - TMB-high/MSI-H are tumor-specific biomarkers
   - Checkpoint inhibitors work for TMB-high/MSI-H regardless of germline status
   - Sporadic patients can benefit from immunotherapy

3. **Why Confidence Capping is Needed**:
   - Tumor NGS data quality varies (L0/L1/L2 completeness)
   - Low-quality data should not have high confidence
   - Capping reflects data quality honestly

4. **Why Treatment Line Intelligence Matters**:
   - Sporadic cases often have complex treatment histories
   - Cross-resistance is more complex in sporadic (multi-hit evolution)
   - Line appropriateness prevents inappropriate sequencing
