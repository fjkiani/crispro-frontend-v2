---


PHASE 1B: Kinetics-only (KELIM replication)
  Goal: CA-125 kinetics predicts outcomes
  Data: Serial CA-125 + outcomes ⏳ PLCO PENDING
  Expected: AUROC 0.60-0.70 (kinetics alone)
  Status: ⏳ WAITING ON PLCO APPROVAL (Jan 2-6)
  Owner: Agent 2 (Engineer - harness + validation)

PHASE 1C: Multi-modal (MAPK + CA-125)
  Goal: EARLIER detection than either alone
  Data: Baseline MAPK + serial CA-125 + resistance outcomes
  Expected: AUROC 0.65-0.75 (combined signals)
  Status: ❌ NEED TREATMENT COHORT (S4 must acquire)
  Owner: Agent 3 (Scientist - data source mapping)

PHASE 2: Add ctDNA (restoration/escape)
  Goal: Mechanistic resistance detection
  Data: Longitudinal genomics + CA-125 + outcomes
  Expected: AUROC 0.70-0.80+ (full multi-modal)
  Status: ❌ LONG-TERM (4-8+ months to acquire)
  Owner: Future work

## **HOW S1 CHANGES AGENT PRIORITIES**

### **Before S1:**

UNCLEAR:
  - Why did Resistance Prophet fail? (mysterious)
  - What data do we need? (vague "serial CA-125")
  - What's the validation path? (one big validation)

RISK:
  - Might pursue wrong data sources
  - Might expect PLCO to validate full hypothesis
  - Might not prioritize treatment cohorts
```


***

### **After S1:**

```yaml
CLEAR:
  ✅ Failure explained: Baseline can't predict adaptive
