# CrisPRO.ai Doctrine 101 – What it is, what it does, why it matters

Purpose: A single, plain‑language reference that explains the platform, how it is orchestrated, what we can do today (research‑mode/RUO), where the code lives, and how partners derive value. Use this as the onboarding doc and the investor‑friendly overview that stays grounded in our code.

RUO disclaimer (always): Results are for research and prioritization only. No clinical claims. Privacy first; provenance always.

## What’s special about our performance (plain language)
- We compose state‑of‑the‑art building blocks and make them work together with provenance.
- Zero‑shot variant science from Evo2 (paper): state‑of‑the‑art on noncoding/regulatory variants; competitive on coding variants. Our stack uses these strengths for VUS, pathway context, and therapy fit.
- Missense coverage from AlphaMissense (Fusion mode) where applicable. We label Fusion runs clearly and keep Baseline deterministic.
- Benchmarks (internal, research‑mode): HRD control runs show stable baselines; we add lifts with richer sequence signals and Fusion where covered. Every run is exportable with run IDs.

## State‑of‑the‑art building blocks we leverage
- Evo2 (paper): zero‑shot SOTA for noncoding; strong coding performance; 1M‑token context; biologically grounded features.
- AlphaMissense: leading missense pathogenicity prior used in Fusion profile when eligible.
- Our orchestration: S/P/E fusion with insight chips; conservative confidence and transparent evidence tiers; caching and provenance throughout.

## Executive overview (plain language)
- What it is: An in‑silico copilot that turns raw genetics into clear, ranked guidance you can act on. It helps you decide what likely matters and what to try next, then packages it so teams can move fast with confidence.
- Who it’s for: Biotech R&D, translational teams, diagnostics labs, and partners who want auditable, research‑mode answers quickly.
- What you get in minutes: Simple insight chips that explain variant impact, a ranked therapy hypothesis with confidence and citations, and a one‑click dossier you can share.

## Three lenses to understand CrisPRO

### 1) In‑silico (computer‑simulated) decision support
- What it does: Simulates how a variant may affect biology and how that lines up with potential therapies.
- Why it helps: You get a fast, transparent starting point before spending time and money in the lab.
- Output: Ranked therapy list with clear confidence, evidence notes, and a shareable record of exactly what was run.

### 2) Precision oncology (research‑mode)
- What it does: Translates a patient’s variants into plain signals (e.g., likely function change, regulatory impact, accessibility).
- Why it helps: Teams can quickly see which variants are worth attention and which therapies might fit the mechanism.
- Output: An explainable “Will it work for me?” view with confidence and citations, plus a Target Dossier for review.

### 3) Genetic testing (VUS enrichment)
- What it does: Enriches Variants of Uncertain Significance with clear, human‑readable context and next actions.
- Why it helps: Reports move from “unknown” to “understood and actionable” (research‑mode), improving follow‑up and discussion.
- Output: Insight chips, coverage/prior badges, and a concise narrative you can include in research reports.

## How it works (no jargon)
1) Paste or upload variants (or select a small cohort).
2) The copilot converts raw genetics into four simple signals: Function, Regulatory, Essentiality, Chromatin.
3) It asks, “Will this therapy work?” and returns a ranked list with confidence and citations.
4) Export a Dossier or continue exploring (e.g., design readiness in demo mode).

## What’s inside (modules you can turn on today)
- VUS Explorer: instant insight chips and a one‑page summary you can share.
- Therapy Fit (Chemo): ranked drug classes with confidence, short “why,” and citations.
- Radiation Readiness: radiosensitivity and toxicity risk hints for planning discussions.
- CRISPR Readiness: feasibility, access, off‑target preview (demo), delivery notes (demo).
- Evidence Intelligence: citations and badges with provenance for trust.
- Knowledge Base: reusable facts, helper text, and coverage chips across the app.
- Clinical Trials Co‑Pilot: fast shortlist with clear eligibility labels (Likely/Potential/Unlikely) and a shareable one‑pager.
- Cohort Lab: small extracts and baseline benchmarks to ground results.

## What you get (deliverables)
- Insight Chips: four plain signals with short “what this means” helpers.
- Therapy Hypothesis: ranked options with confidence, evidence tier, badges, and citations.
- Target Dossier: a clean, shareable summary with provenance (run ID, profile, inputs snapshot).
- Cohort Lab (optional): quick extraction + a baseline benchmark to prove repeatability.

## Dossier → a blueprint for the next step
- What it contains: the variants analyzed, the insight chips, ranked therapy view, citations, confidence, and run IDs.
- Why it matters: it lets wet‑lab partners or trial teams start from a clear, auditable blueprint instead of a blank page.
- How it’s used: plan experiments, brief tumor boards, enroll in trials faster (RUO).

## Why trust it (research‑mode guardrails)
- Provenance by default: every run includes a run ID, chosen profile, and inputs/outputs snapshot.
- Conservative by design: clear research‑mode labels, safe default profile, and transparent confidence.
- No black boxes: you can see sources and rationale; when something isn’t available, the UI says so.

## Business value (what partners get)
- Faster decisions: minutes to a ranked, explainable hypothesis, not weeks.
- Lower cost and risk: start in‑silico, then invest selectively in wet‑lab work.
- Audit‑ready: clean dossiers with provenance and citations for internal review and partner discussions.
- Scalable: profile toggles (Baseline → Richer → Fusion) let you balance speed and depth.

## Engagement options (indicative)
- SaaS pilot (research‑mode): access to VUS Explorer, WIWFM, Dossier, and Cohort Lab.
- Cohort projects: extract/label/benchmark studies; compare profiles; capture artifacts.
- Co‑development: when our copilot materially contributes to a novel design, we help document contribution for future IP discussions.

## The platform in one line
A computational platform that analyzes genetic variants and predicts which cancer drugs will work for specific patients, then designs CRISPR guides to fix genetic problems – all with clear explanations of why and how confident we are.

## Core principles
- **Every result is traceable**: Every analysis gets a unique ID, shows exactly what data was used, and can be reproduced
- **Three analysis modes**: Fast & safe (Baseline), More detailed (Richer), Enhanced with external data (Fusion)
- **Safety first**: We check for dangerous mutations before running expensive analyses
- **Honest about limitations**: We tell you how confident we are and what evidence supports our predictions
- **Built for researchers**: Clean APIs that can be integrated into existing lab workflows
