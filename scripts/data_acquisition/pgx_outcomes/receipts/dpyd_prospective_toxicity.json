      "abstract": "Despite the implementation of DPYD genotype-guided dosing, approximately 1 in 3 patients receiving fluoropyrimidine-containing chemotherapy continues to experience severe toxicity. While clinical studies have demonstrated a favorable tolerance among highly selected fit older adults, real-world studies have shown an increased risk of toxicity. To identify predictors of severe toxicity or treatment deintensification in older DPYD wild-type adults receiving fluoropyrimidine-containing chemotherapy. Patients wild type for four tested DPYD variants, aged &#x2265;65&#x2009;years, who participated in a prospective clinical trial investigating genotype-guided individualized fluoropyrimidine dosing, were eligible for the study. The association between tumor-, treatment-, and patient-related characteristics and the occurrence of severe toxicity (grade &#x2265;3, CTCAE v5.0) was analyzed in univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. The same analyses were performed for a composite endpoint of severe toxicity or treatment deintensification (including dose reduction, cycle delay, or discontinuation). A total of 311 patients were included. Median age was 71.2&#xa0;years and 58.8% were male. Grade &#x2265;3 toxicity occurred in 23.2% of patients. In multivariate analysis, none of the characteristics studied were significantly associated with the occurrence of grade &#x2265;3 toxicity. The composite endpoint occurred in 41.2% of patients and was associated with the use of full dose monotherapy in multivariate analysis. Despite DPYD genotype-based dosing, grade &#x2265;3 toxicity and treatment deintensification frequently occur in older patients treated with fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy. No patient-related variables were found to be associated with grade &#x2265;3 toxicity, but treatment with dose-reduced monotherapy resulted in fewer treatment deintensification or severe toxicity events. &#xa9; 2025 The Author(s).

      "abstract": "To determine the feasibility and effectiveness of implementing pretreatment DPYD/UGT1A1 testing in patients with gastrointestinal cancer and its impact compared with a biobank population. A prospective, nonrandomized implementation trial of pretreatment DPYD/UGT1A1 testing with preemptive dose reduction was conducted in patients initiating treatment with a fluoropyrimidine (FP, [fluorouracil or capecitabine]) or irinotecan. The primary end point was feasibility, defined as proportion of results available prior to cycle 1 of treatment. Secondarily, occurrence of severe treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs), defined as toxicity resulting in hospitalization or emergency department visit, was compared with a biobank population receiving standard dose chemotherapy. Of the 288 patients prospectively tested, 225 (median age 60.7 years, 54% male, 18% Black, 47% colorectal cancer) received a qualifying chemotherapy. Eight of 11 DPYD variant carriers received an FP and eight of 39 UGT1A1 poor metabolizers received irinotecan. The median test turnaround time was 10 days (IQR, 9-13) with 57.4% of results available before cycle 1. Eleven of 16 (69%) participants with a drug-gene interaction (DGI) had results available before chemotherapy initiation and received pharmacogenetic-recommended dose reductions. Compared with the biobank cohort (n = 229), the prospective DGI group experienced fewer severe TRAEs (38% v 65%, P = .123), treatment discontinuations (31% v 47%, P = .356), and treatment modifications (38% v 76%, P = .028). Pretreatment DPYD/UGT1A1 testing and dose reduction was feasible, enabling clinicians to make the appropriate chemotherapy dose reductions, reducing occurrence of adverse outcomes. DPYD/UGT1A1 testing is an important precision oncology approach to optimize patient safety.",

      "title": "Impact of Upfront DPYD Genotyping on Fluoropyrimidine Adjuvant Therapy in Colorectal Cancer: A Real-World Data.",
      "abstract": "The application of fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy in colorectal cancer treatment is known to pose significant toxicity risks, which can be mitigated by tailoring treatment according to DPYD gene variants. This study evaluates the impact of DPYD genotype-guided dosing on treatment-related toxicities and patient outcomes. A retrospective analysis was conducted on CRC patients treated with fluoropyrimidines in adjuvant setting at The Wellbeing Services County of Ostrobothnia. Patients were divided into two cohorts based on the implementation of routine DPYD genotyping: pregenotyping (2016-2018) (n = 80) and postgenotyping (2020-2022) (n = 69). The incidence of side effects, treatment discontinuation, hospitalization, and 90-day mortality were compared between groups. The study revealed a reduction in 90-day mortality rates among patients who underwent DPYD genotyping before treatment. Patients with pathogenic DPYD variants received &#x2265;50% reduced doses initially, leading to no severe toxicities (grade &#x2265;3). Class 3 variants showed similar side effect profiles and hospitalization rates as untested patients but had a lower rate of treatment discontinuation. Upfront DPYD genotyping appears to improve patient safety in CRC patients treated with adjuvant fluoropyrimidines, leading to personalized dosing that reduces severe toxicities and early mortality. These findings underscore the importance of integrating pharmacogenetic testing in clinical oncology to optimize treatment regimens and enhance patient care. Copyright &#xa9; 2025 Elsevier Inc.

      "abstract": "Inherited dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency is a risk factor for severe 5-fluorouracil toxicity. We report a phenotyping approach (thymine challenge test) to prospectively determine DPD activity and the association with severe adverse events. The primary aim of this prospective study was to determine whether a thymine challenge test could prospectively identify patients at risk of severe toxicity from treatment with 5-fluorouracil/capecitabine in combination chemotherapy schedules or monotherapy. The focus was prediction of those at risk of &#x2265;&#x2009;grade 3 gastrointestinal toxicity. DPD activity was determined from the thymine/dihydrothymine (THY/DHT) ratio measured in a urine sample after a thymine test dose (250&#xa0;mg, oral). Of the 166 patients, 11.7% had severe diarrhoea/mucositis. The THY/DHT ratio was not significantly different in these individuals compared to those with minimal toxicity. However, post hoc analysis found decreased DPD activity in those who had non-gastrointestinal toxicity, most notably grade&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;2 Hand-Foot syndrome (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001). The data do not support our primary hypothesis that this phenotyping approach would discriminate those at risk of severe/life-threatening gastrointestinal toxicity.

      "abstract": "DPYD gene variations are associated with severe fluoropyrimidine toxicity, and an initial 50% dose reduction is widely recommended for heterozygous carriers of relevant DPYD variants, including DPYD*2A, DPYD*13, c.2846A&gt;T, and c.1236G&gt;A. However, there is a high variability in DPD activity between DPYD variant carriers, and a proportion of patients may tolerate higher fluoropyrimidine doses. The aim of this retrospective study was to compare fluoropyrimidine toxicity outcomes and tolerated dose intensities between different DPYD variant carriers that received DPYD genotype-guided dosing. We identified DPYD variant carriers that received fluoropyrimidine-based treatment between January 2015 and February 2021 in three Dutch Hospitals. The initial fluoropyrimidine dose was reduced by 25-50% for all heterozygous DPYD variant carriers following the Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group guideline. Toxicity outcomes were collected for the first three cycles. From 2112 consecutively DPYD-genotyped patients, 120 patients with DPYD variants were included. The frequency of overall severe toxicity was 21% for wild types, 27% for heterozygous DPYD variant carriers overall, 19% for c.1236G&gt;A carriers, 38% for c.2846A&gt;T carriers, and 44% for DPYD*2A carriers. Median relative dose intensity for cycles 1-3 was 71% for c.1236G&gt;A carriers, 68% for c.2846A&gt;T carriers, and 52% for DPYD*2A carriers. Despite good fluoropyrimidine tolerance in a large proportion of patients, only 13% of patients underwent dose escalation. Novel studies are highly needed to establish the optimal fluoropyrimidine starting dose for heterozygous carriers of c.1236G&gt;A. After initial dose reduction, dose uptitration based on individual tolerance and therapeutic drug monitoring in all DPYD variant heterozygotes is advised to prevent the risk of underdosing. &#xa9; 2025 The Author(s).

      "title": "Thymine as potential biomarker to predict 5-FU systemic exposure in patients with gastro-intestinal cancer: a prospective pharmacokinetic study (FUUT-trial).",
      "abstract": "In 20-30% of the patients, fluoropyrimidines (5-FU) based chemotherapy leads to severe toxicity, which is associated with dihydropyridine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency. Therefore, DPYD genotyping became standard practice before treatment with fluoropyrimidines. Nevertheless, only 17% of the patients with severe toxicity have a DPYD variant. Therefore, an urgent need persists to investigate other strategies contributing to prediction and prevention of toxicity. Endogenous DPD substrates are considered as potential biomarkers to predict toxicity, yet contradictional data exist on demonstrating uracil as a reliable biomarker. Thymine as biomarker for toxicity has been investigated less. The aim of this study was to determine the association between the concentrations of uracil, thymine dihydrouracil (DHU) and dihydrothymine (DHT), with the systemic drug exposure of 5-FU and DPD enzyme activity in patients treated with 5-FU. We included 36 patients with gastrointestinal malignancy who received 5-FU infusion. DPYD genotyping was conducted before start of treatment. Blood samples for determining 5-FU, uracil and thymine concentrations during infusion and DPD enzyme activity were taken. We found a significant correlation between the 5-FU systematic exposure and baseline thymine concentrations (R 2 &#x2009;=&#x2009;0.1468; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0402). DPD enzyme activity was significantly correlated with baseline thymine concentrations but no correlation was found between DPD enzyme activity and 5-FU systemic drug exposure. 5-FU dose individualization based on thymine concentrations could be a promising addition to DPYD genotyping to predict 5-FU-induced toxicity.

      "title": "DPYD -guided fluoropyrimidine dose adjustment in colorectal cancer DPYD carriers: start slower to finish stronger.",
      "abstract": "Fluoropyrimidines (FP) are the mainstay of colorectal cancer (CRC) treatment, but can cause severe toxicity in up to 40% of patients. Variants in the DPYD gene are associated with these adverse events. A DPYD -guide dose adjustment is now recommended in Europe. This ambispective study aims to analyze the FP-related severe toxicity and the FP dose adjustment in heterozygous DPYD variant carriers with colorectal cancer, comparing a DPYD -guided FP dose adjustment (DA) approach to the non- DPYD -guided FP dose adjustment (NDA). 1.279 DPYD genotyping reports were issued. Sixty patients were identified with DPYD variants. Twenty-five CRC patients (17 in the DA cohort and 8 in the NDA cohort) were included in the analysis. Thirty-five patients were excluded from the analysis because they did not satisfy any of the study's inclusion criteria. Reasons for exclusion included having a diagnosis other than colorectal cancer, not receiving fluoropyrimidine treatment, participation in a clinical trial, or insufficient follow-up. Of the twenty-five patients included, sixteen patients (94%) started with a 50% FP dose reduction in the DA cohort while 7 out of 8 patients (87%) in the NDA cohort received 100% of dose in cycle 1. In the DA cohort, 12% of patients experienced severe fluoropyrimidines-related adverse events, compared to 50% in the NDA cohort (OR = 0.13; 95%CI: 0.01-0.93; p = 0.05). FP discontinuation due to severe toxicity occurred in 6% of patients in the DA cohort versus 50% in the NDA cohort (OR = 0.06; 95%CI: 0.003-0.55, p = 0.02). These findings suggest that DPYD -guided dose adjustment significantly reduces both the incidence of severe toxicity and the rate of treatment discontinuation in CRC patients. Initiating treatment with a 50% FP reduction allows for dose escalation in patients who exhibit good tolerance and avoid the discontinuation for those patients intolerant to higher doses thereby improving overall treatment adherence and completion.

After surgery, 43 patients (stages II and III, according to the current 8th TNM/UICC-classification, 2017) received FOLFOX-CTx and entered follow-up (median: 101 months). According to recent recommendations of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and national guidelines, post-hoc genotyping for DPYD*2A (c.1905&#x2009;+&#x2009;1G&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;A; IVS14&#x2009;+&#x2009;1G&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;A; rs3918290), DPYD*13 (c.1679T&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;G; rs55886062), polymorphism c.2846&#xa0;A&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;T (rs67376798) and Haplotype B3 (HapB3) (c.1236G&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;A; c.1129-5923&#xa0;C&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;G) was performed using cryopreserved blood samples and standardized PCR-techniques. Five patients were found to have a heterozygous (het_) DPYD-HapB3-status. Across all patients, the adherence to CTx-cycles 1 to 4 was 100%, 97.7%, 95.3%, and 93.0%, respectively. Grade&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;3 CTC-AEs were observed in 0.9% of both het_HapB3- and WT-patients. The mean administered dose of 5-FU was 68.8% of the target in DPYD-HapB3 carriers, compared to 92.6% in 38 WT patients. Logistic regression analysis revealed that 5-FU dose reductions were significantly associated with DPYD-HapB3 carrier status (odds ratio [OR] 12.55, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.044) and male sex (OR 0.23, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.049). During follow-up het_HapB3-patients had a recurrence rate of 60.0%, compared to 13,6% for WT-patients. The disease-free survival (DFS) for het_HapB3-patients was significantly reduced vs. WT (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.010). Multivariable analysis showed that het_HapB3-patients had an increased risk for reduced DFS (HR 3.774; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.057). Interestingly, 5-FU dose reductions per se were not significantly associated with limited DFS in the total population. DPYD genotyping revealed a het_HapB3 variant in 11.6% of DPYD*2A-WT patients treated with FOLFOX. While not linked to increased toxicity, HapB3 status was associated with reduced DFS, suggesting an impact on treatment efficacy. These results support DPYD genotyping and highlight the need for adequate 5-FU plasma level assessment followed by subtile dose escalation (therapeutic drug monitoring) to personalize 5-FU dosing more precisely, safely and most effective. &#xa9; 2025.

      "abstract": "PREDICT-5FU aimed to document 5-fluorouracil (5FU) exposure in a cancer population and to evaluate the feasibility of 5FU and capecitabine therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) in patients receiving standard doses and schedules. Multicentre, prospective, observational single-arm study. Eligible adult patients received 5FU (infusional &#x2265;24&#x2009;h) or capecitabine. Patients were treated for gastrointestinal, breast and head-and-neck cancers at four Australian hospitals. TDM was performed in consecutive cycles until target area under the curve (AUC) was reached. Pharmacogenetic testing was performed for all patients. Fifty patients (24 males, 26 females) were recruited. Median age was 63&#x2009;years; common diagnoses were lower gastrointestinal cancers 40% (20/50) and metastatic disease 80% (40/50). The majority received 5FU (38/50, 76%) over 46 h. Only 36% of 5FU patients achieved target AUC when dosed based on body surface area; 61% were below and 3% above target range. Post TDM-adjusted dosing, target AUC was achieved in 58% of patients (22% absolute increase vs. BSA dosing, p = 0.03), within median three cycles (range 1-5). DPYD variant allele carriers (3/4) had upfront reduced dosing due to heterozygosity; all were below the target AUC and one experienced Grade 3 toxicity. There was no correlation between dihydrouracil: uracil ratio [UH2/U] or uracilemia [U] and DPYD genotype. TDM results were reported with an average of 4 days from sampling. TDM dosing is feasible and increases the proportion of patients reaching target AUC. Findings are relevant across all cancers treated with 5FU, and particularly for DPYD variant allele carriers receiving upfront dose reductions. &#xa9; 2025 The Author(s).

      "abstract": "Standard dosing of infusional 5-FU results in subtherapeutic drug exposure for up to half of all patients. We evaluated plasma uracil concentration and DPYD rs4294451 genotype as candidate predictors of individual-level 5-FU exposure. We conducted a prospective study of drug exposure in patients with gastrointestinal cancer receiving infusional 5-FU. Participants were evaluated by measurement of fasting pretreatment plasma uracil concentration, DPYD gene sequence (including genotyping of rs4294451) and 5-FU area under the curve (5-FU AUC). We used a linear mixed-effects model to evaluate the association of 5-FU AUC with uracil concentration and rs4294451 genotype, adjusting for cycle number, sex, serum creatinine, and 5-FU dose. There were 29 evaluable participants with a median age of 64 years (range 41-81); nine (31%) were female. The median plasma uracil concentration was 10.4 ng/mL (IQR 7.2, 12.6). Nine participants carried the DPYD rs4294451 T-allele (7 with T/A, 2 with T/T.) Among all participants the median 5-FU AUC was 22.0&#xa0;mg*h/L in cycle 1 and 19.3&#xa0;mg*h/L in cycle 2. In the mixed-effects model, higher rs4294451 T-allele count (0, 1, or 2) was significantly associated with lower 5-FU AUC (-4.0&#xa0;mg*h/L per T-allele [95% CI -8.0, 0.0], p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.049), as was male sex (-7.5&#xa0;mg*h/L [95% CI -13.8, -1.3], p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.021). Pretreatment plasma uracil concentration was not significantly associated with 5-FU AUC (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.57). The subject with the highest uracil concentration (23.1 ng/mL) had a rare DPYD missense variant (c.2185G&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;A [p.A729T]) and experienced early 5-FU-related toxicity. DPYD rs4294451 T-allele count and male sex were significantly associated with reduced 5-FU drug exposure. DPYD rs4294451 and male sex merit further evaluation as candidate biomarkers to inform initial dosing of infusional 5-FU. &#xa9; 2025. The Author(s).",

      "abstract": "Despite the implementation of DPYD genotype-guided dosing, approximately 1 in 3 patients receiving fluoropyrimidine-containing chemotherapy continues to experience severe toxicity. While clinical studies have demonstrated a favorable tolerance among highly selected fit older adults, real-world studies have shown an increased risk of toxicity. To identify predictors of severe toxicity or treatment deintensification in older DPYD wild-type adults receiving fluoropyrimidine-containing chemotherapy. Patients wild type for four tested DPYD variants, aged &#x2265;65&#x2009;years, who participated in a prospective clinical trial investigating genotype-guided individualized fluoropyrimidine dosing, were eligible for the study. The association between tumor-, treatment-, and patient-related characteristics and the occurrence of severe toxicity (grade &#x2265;3, CTCAE v5.0) was analyzed in univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. The same analyses were performed for a composite endpoint of severe toxicity or treatment deintensification (including dose reduction, cycle delay, or discontinuation). A total of 311 patients were included. Median age was 71.2&#xa0;years and 58.8% were male. Grade &#x2265;3 toxicity occurred in 23.2% of patients. In multivariate analysis, none of the characteristics studied were significantly associated with the occurrence of grade &#x2265;3 toxicity. The composite endpoint occurred in 41.2% of patients and was associated with the use of full dose monotherapy in multivariate analysis. Despite DPYD genotype-based dosing, grade &#x2265;3 toxicity and treatment deintensification frequently occur in older patients treated with fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy. No patient-related variables were found to be associated with grade &#x2265;3 toxicity, but treatment with dose-reduced monotherapy resulted in fewer treatment deintensification or severe toxicity events. &#xa9; 2025 The Author(s).

      "abstract": "To determine the feasibility and effectiveness of implementing pretreatment DPYD/UGT1A1 testing in patients with gastrointestinal cancer and its impact compared with a biobank population. A prospective, nonrandomized implementation trial of pretreatment DPYD/UGT1A1 testing with preemptive dose reduction was conducted in patients initiating treatment with a fluoropyrimidine (FP, [fluorouracil or capecitabine]) or irinotecan. The primary end point was feasibility, defined as proportion of results available prior to cycle 1 of treatment. Secondarily, occurrence of severe treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs), defined as toxicity resulting in hospitalization or emergency department visit, was compared with a biobank population receiving standard dose chemotherapy. Of the 288 patients prospectively tested, 225 (median age 60.7 years, 54% male, 18% Black, 47% colorectal cancer) received a qualifying chemotherapy. Eight of 11 DPYD variant carriers received an FP and eight of 39 UGT1A1 poor metabolizers received irinotecan. The median test turnaround time was 10 days (IQR, 9-13) with 57.4% of results available before cycle 1. Eleven of 16 (69%) participants with a drug-gene interaction (DGI) had results available before chemotherapy initiation and received pharmacogenetic-recommended dose reductions. Compared with the biobank cohort (n = 229), the prospective DGI group experienced fewer severe TRAEs (38% v 65%, P = .123), treatment discontinuations (31% v 47%, P = .356), and treatment modifications (38% v 76%, P = .028). Pretreatment DPYD/UGT1A1 testing and dose reduction was feasible, enabling clinicians to make the appropriate chemotherapy dose reductions, reducing occurrence of adverse outcomes.

      "abstract": "The application of fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy in colorectal cancer treatment is known to pose significant toxicity risks, which can be mitigated by tailoring treatment according to DPYD gene variants. This study evaluates the impact of DPYD genotype-guided dosing on treatment-related toxicities and patient outcomes. A retrospective analysis was conducted on CRC patients treated with fluoropyrimidines in adjuvant setting at The Wellbeing Services County of Ostrobothnia. Patients were divided into two cohorts based on the implementation of routine DPYD genotyping: pregenotyping (2016-2018) (n = 80) and postgenotyping (2020-2022) (n = 69). The incidence of side effects, treatment discontinuation, hospitalization, and 90-day mortality were compared between groups. The study revealed a reduction in 90-day mortality rates among patients who underwent DPYD genotyping before treatment. Patients with pathogenic DPYD variants received &#x2265;50% reduced doses initially, leading to no severe toxicities (grade &#x2265;3). Class 3 variants showed similar side effect profiles and hospitalization rates as untested patients but had a lower rate of treatment discontinuation. Upfront DPYD genotyping appears to improve patient safety in CRC patients treated with adjuvant fluoropyrimidines, leading to personalized dosing that reduces severe toxicities and early mortality. These findings underscore the importance of integrating pharmacogenetic testing in clinical oncology to optimize treatment regimens and enhance patient care. Copyright &#xa9; 2025 Elsevier Inc.

We report a phenotyping approach (thymine challenge test) to prospectively determine DPD activity and the association with severe adverse events. The primary aim of this prospective study was to determine whether a thymine challenge test could prospectively identify patients at risk of severe toxicity from treatment with 5-fluorouracil/capecitabine in combination chemotherapy schedules or monotherapy. The focus was prediction of those at risk of &#x2265;&#x2009;grade 3 gastrointestinal toxicity. DPD activity was determined from the thymine/dihydrothymine (THY/DHT) ratio measured in a urine sample after a thymine test dose (250&#xa0;mg, oral). Of the 166 patients, 11.7% had severe diarrhoea/mucositis. The THY/DHT ratio was not significantly different in these individuals compared to those with minimal toxicity.

      "abstract": "DPYD gene variations are associated with severe fluoropyrimidine toxicity, and an initial 50% dose reduction is widely recommended for heterozygous carriers of relevant DPYD variants, including DPYD*2A, DPYD*13, c.2846A&gt;T, and c.1236G&gt;A. However, there is a high variability in DPD activity between DPYD variant carriers, and a proportion of patients may tolerate higher fluoropyrimidine doses. The aim of this retrospective study was to compare fluoropyrimidine toxicity outcomes and tolerated dose intensities between different DPYD variant carriers that received DPYD genotype-guided dosing. We identified DPYD variant carriers that received fluoropyrimidine-based treatment between January 2015 and February 2021 in three Dutch Hospitals. The initial fluoropyrimidine dose was reduced by 25-50% for all heterozygous DPYD variant carriers following the Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group guideline. Toxicity outcomes were collected for the first three cycles. From 2112 consecutively DPYD-genotyped patients, 120 patients with DPYD variants were included. The frequency of overall severe toxicity was 21% for wild types, 27% for heterozygous DPYD variant carriers overall, 19% for c.1236G&gt;A carriers, 38% for c.2846A&gt;T carriers, and 44% for DPYD*2A carriers. Median relative dose intensity for cycles 1-3 was 71% for c.1236G&gt;A carriers, 68% for c.2846A&gt;T carriers, and 52% for DPYD*2A carriers. Despite good fluoropyrimidine tolerance in a large proportion of patients, only 13% of patients underwent dose escalation. Novel studies are highly needed to establish the optimal fluoropyrimidine starting dose for heterozygous carriers of c.1236G&gt;A. After initial dose reduction, dose uptitration based on individual tolerance and therapeutic drug monitoring in all DPYD variant heterozygotes is advised to prevent the risk of underdosing. &#xa9; 2025 The Author(s).

      "abstract": "In 20-30% of the patients, fluoropyrimidines (5-FU) based chemotherapy leads to severe toxicity, which is associated with dihydropyridine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency. Therefore, DPYD genotyping became standard practice before treatment with fluoropyrimidines. Nevertheless, only 17% of the patients with severe toxicity have a DPYD variant. Therefore, an urgent need persists to investigate other strategies contributing to prediction and prevention of toxicity. Endogenous DPD substrates are considered as potential biomarkers to predict toxicity, yet contradictional data exist on demonstrating uracil as a reliable biomarker. Thymine as biomarker for toxicity has been investigated less. The aim of this study was to determine the association between the concentrations of uracil, thymine dihydrouracil (DHU) and dihydrothymine (DHT), with the systemic drug exposure of 5-FU and DPD enzyme activity in patients treated with 5-FU. We included 36 patients with gastrointestinal malignancy who received 5-FU infusion. DPYD genotyping was conducted before start of treatment. Blood samples for determining 5-FU, uracil and thymine concentrations during infusion and DPD enzyme activity were taken. We found a significant correlation between the 5-FU systematic exposure and baseline thymine concentrations (R 2 &#x2009;=&#x2009;0.1468; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0402). DPD enzyme activity was significantly correlated with baseline thymine concentrations but no correlation was found between DPD enzyme activity and 5-FU systemic drug exposure. 5-FU dose individualization based on thymine concentrations could be a promising addition to DPYD genotyping to predict 5-FU-induced toxicity.

      "abstract": "Fluoropyrimidines (FP) are the mainstay of colorectal cancer (CRC) treatment, but can cause severe toxicity in up to 40% of patients. Variants in the DPYD gene are associated with these adverse events. A DPYD -guide dose adjustment is now recommended in Europe. This ambispective study aims to analyze the FP-related severe toxicity and the FP dose adjustment in heterozygous DPYD variant carriers with colorectal cancer, comparing a DPYD -guided FP dose adjustment (DA) approach to the non- DPYD -guided FP dose adjustment (NDA). 1.279 DPYD genotyping reports were issued. Sixty patients were identified with DPYD variants. Twenty-five CRC patients (17 in the DA cohort and 8 in the NDA cohort) were included in the analysis. Thirty-five patients were excluded from the analysis because they did not satisfy any of the study's inclusion criteria. Reasons for exclusion included having a diagnosis other than colorectal cancer, not receiving fluoropyrimidine treatment, participation in a clinical trial, or insufficient follow-up. Of the twenty-five patients included, sixteen patients (94%) started with a 50% FP dose reduction in the DA cohort while 7 out of 8 patients (87%) in the NDA cohort received 100% of dose in cycle 1. In the DA cohort, 12% of patients experienced severe fluoropyrimidines-related adverse events, compared to 50% in the NDA cohort (OR = 0.13; 95%CI: 0.01-0.93; p = 0.05). FP discontinuation due to severe toxicity occurred in 6% of patients in the DA cohort versus 50% in the NDA cohort (OR = 0.06; 95%CI: 0.003-0.55, p = 0.02). These findings suggest that DPYD -guided dose adjustment significantly reduces both the incidence of severe toxicity and the rate of treatment discontinuation in CRC patients. Initiating treatment with a 50% FP reduction allows for dose escalation in patients who exhibit good tolerance and avoid the discontinuation for those patients intolerant to higher doses thereby improving overall treatment adherence and completion.

Interestingly, 5-FU dose reductions per se were not significantly associated with limited DFS in the total population. DPYD genotyping revealed a het_HapB3 variant in 11.6% of DPYD*2A-WT patients treated with FOLFOX. While not linked to increased toxicity, HapB3 status was associated with reduced DFS, suggesting an impact on treatment efficacy. These results support DPYD genotyping and highlight the need for adequate 5-FU plasma level assessment followed by subtile dose escalation (therapeutic drug monitoring) to personalize 5-FU dosing more precisely, safely and most effective. &#xa9; 2025.

      "abstract": "PREDICT-5FU aimed to document 5-fluorouracil (5FU) exposure in a cancer population and to evaluate the feasibility of 5FU and capecitabine therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) in patients receiving standard doses and schedules. Multicentre, prospective, observational single-arm study. Eligible adult patients received 5FU (infusional &#x2265;24&#x2009;h) or capecitabine. Patients were treated for gastrointestinal, breast and head-and-neck cancers at four Australian hospitals. TDM was performed in consecutive cycles until target area under the curve (AUC) was reached. Pharmacogenetic testing was performed for all patients. Fifty patients (24 males, 26 females) were recruited. Median age was 63&#x2009;years; common diagnoses were lower gastrointestinal cancers 40% (20/50) and metastatic disease 80% (40/50). The majority received 5FU (38/50, 76%) over 46 h. Only 36% of 5FU patients achieved target AUC when dosed based on body surface area; 61% were below and 3% above target range. Post TDM-adjusted dosing, target AUC was achieved in 58% of patients (22% absolute increase vs. BSA dosing, p = 0.03), within median three cycles (range 1-5). DPYD variant allele carriers (3/4) had upfront reduced dosing due to heterozygosity; all were below the target AUC and one experienced Grade 3 toxicity. There was no correlation between dihydrouracil: uracil ratio [UH2/U] or uracilemia [U] and DPYD genotype. TDM results were reported with an average of 4 days from sampling. TDM dosing is feasible and increases the proportion of patients reaching target AUC. Findings are relevant across all cancers treated with 5FU, and particularly for DPYD variant allele carriers receiving upfront dose reductions. &#xa9; 2025 The Author(s).

We evaluated plasma uracil concentration and DPYD rs4294451 genotype as candidate predictors of individual-level 5-FU exposure. We conducted a prospective study of drug exposure in patients with gastrointestinal cancer receiving infusional 5-FU. Participants were evaluated by measurement of fasting pretreatment plasma uracil concentration, DPYD gene sequence (including genotyping of rs4294451) and 5-FU area under the curve (5-FU AUC). We used a linear mixed-effects model to evaluate the association of 5-FU AUC with uracil concentration and rs4294451 genotype, adjusting for cycle number, sex, serum creatinine, and 5-FU dose. There were 29 evaluable participants with a median age of 64 years (range 41-81); nine (31%) were female. The median plasma uracil concentration was 10.4 ng/mL (IQR 7.2, 12.6). Nine participants carried the DPYD rs4294451 T-allele (7 with T/A, 2 with T/T.) Among all participants the median 5-FU AUC was 22.0&#xa0;mg*h/L in cycle 1 and 19.3&#xa0;mg*h/L in cycle 2. In the mixed-effects model, higher rs4294451 T-allele count (0, 1, or 2) was significantly associated with lower 5-FU AUC (-4.0&#xa0;mg*h/L per T-allele [95% CI -8.0, 0.0], p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.049), as was male sex (-7.5&#xa0;mg*h/L [95% CI -13.8, -1.3], p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.021).

DPYD rs4294451 T-allele count and male sex were significantly associated with reduced 5-FU drug exposure.

      "abstract": "The Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) recommends screening for four common DPYD variants to prevent severe toxicity in patients with cancer treated with fluoropyrimidines. A 50% starting dose followed by toxicity-based dose titration is advised for patients heterozygous for these variants. In this study, the appropriateness of the CPIC-recommended 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) starting dose was evaluated. Patients were grouped into four variant categories ( DPYD *2A [c.1905+1G&gt;A], DPYD *13 [c.1679T&gt;G], c.2846A&gt;T [p.D949V], c.1236G&gt;A/HapB3 [p.E412E]) and a DPYD wild-type control group. Uracil loading tests were used for phenotyping. Variant patients started on a 50% reduced 5-FU dose. On the basis of steady-state 5-FU plasma concentrations, dose adjustments were made during cycles 2-4 until an 5-FU target AUC 0-46h of 20-30 mg &#xd7; h/L was achieved, if tolerated. Twenty-six wild-type controls and 34 DPYD variant patients were included: 16 with c.1236G&gt;A/HapB3, eight with c.1905+1G&gt;A, eight with p.D949V, and two with c.1679T&gt;G. Heterozygous carriers of c.1905+1G&gt;A ( DPYD *2A) and c.1679T&gt;G ( DPYD* 13) displayed significant reduced uracil metabolism. The impact on uracil clearance was highly variable in p.D949V but only minor in c.1236G&gt;A/HapB3 variants. In all, 65% of wild-type controls had 5-FU exposure within target range on a 100% dose (mean, 23.2; IQR, 6.6). In 97% of all variant patients, the 50% reduced dose resulted in 5-FU underexposure, with a median AUC of 10.6 mg &#xd7; h/L (IQR, 3.2). Dose escalation to 70% or higher was tolerated in most patients, reaching the target AUC in 68% of patients. The current CPIC guidelines are overly conservative for c.1236G&gt;A/HapB3 and most p.D949V variants. A 75% starting dose is more appropriate for most c.1236G&gt;A/HapB3 carriers. We recommend 5-FU therapeutic drug monitoring in all patients with DPYD variants to achieve optimal 5-FU exposure.",

However, approximately 23&#x202f;% of patients still experience severe toxicity unexplained by the four commonly tested DPYD-variant alleles. Elevated pre-treatment uracil levels have been proposed as a surrogate marker for reduced DPD activity and an independent predictor of toxicity. This prospective study evaluated whether uracil-guided dose individualisation can reduce severe fluoropyrimidine-induced toxicity in DPYD wild-type patients. Pre-treatment plasma uracil levels were quantified in patients scheduled to receive fluoropyrimidine-based therapy. DPYD wild-type individuals with uracil concentrations &gt;&#x202f;16 ng/mL (DPYD wt /U high ) received a 50&#x202f;% dose reduction, in accordance with French RNPGx guidelines. The incidence of grade &#x2265;&#x202f;3 fluoropyrimidine-related toxicity was compared between dose-reduced DPYD wt /U high patients, DPYD wt patients with uracil &#x2264;&#x202f;16 ng/mL (DPYD wt /U normal ), and a historical cohort of DPYD wt /U high patients treated at full dose. Pharmacokinetic data were compared to a second historical cohort. Among 612 evaluable patients, 22 were DPYD wt /U high . The incidence of severe toxicity in the dose-reduced group was significantly lower than in historical full-dose DPYD wt /U high patients (20&#x202f;% vs 43&#x202f;%, P&#x202f;=&#x202f;0.03) and comparable during the first 2 treatment cycles to DPYD wt /U normal patients (10&#x202f;% vs 11&#x202f;%). However, 5-fluorouracil exposure was markedly reduced in nineteen dose-reduced DPYD wt /U high patients (177 vs 381 ng*h/mL), while five subsequently treated fully dosed DPYD wt /U high patients exhibited comparable exposure to historical wild-type controls (456 vs 381 ng*h/mL). No correlation was found between uracil levels and DPD enzyme activity (R=-0.006, P&#x202f;=&#x202f;0.98). Uracil-guided dosing of fluoropyrimidines may reduce toxicity risk but leads to subtherapeutic 5-fluorouracil exposure in DPYD wild-type patients. This indicates that these patients are treated sub-optimally and that uracil is not a reliable predictor of DPD deficiency in DPYD wild-type patients. Copyright &#xa9; 2025.

      "abstract": "Fluoropyrimidines are a vital component of chemotherapy regimens. Deleterious DPYD variants reduce activity of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, the rate-limiting enzyme of fluoropyrimidine catabolism, resulting in reduced fluoropyrimidine clearance and elevated risk of life-threatening toxicities. DPYD genotype-guided fluoropyrimidine therapy can mitigate the risk of severe life-threatening toxicities, but adoption of testing globally has been limited. We developed a 91-item survey investigating global DPYD implementation strategies to gain insight into common practices and successful strategies. The survey was disseminated to Pharmacogenomics Global Research Network Implementation Working Group members consisting of 54 health care sites across 15 countries. Survey responses were received from 28 sites (52%) across 9 countries. Over 80% of sites implemented, or planned to implement, a preemptive testing strategy (i.e., before a fluoropyrimidine is administered) leveraging the electronic health record (EHR) to disseminate DPYD results to providers. All sites created infrastructure to support DPYD testing (e.g., order sets, EHR decision support), but 70% of sites indicated reliance on clinicians to remember test ordering. Only 2 sites reported high DPYD testing rates (&gt;&#x2009;75%) among patients planned to receive a fluoropyrimidine. Most sites (57%) used in-house clinical laboratories that tested for the majority of DPYD Tier 1 variants. Among sites that had implemented DPYD testing, the median turnaround time was 10&#x2009;days. Few sites indicated that a high percentage (&gt;&#x2009;75%) of DPYD results were returned before fluoropyrimidine administration. Our results suggest that additional implementation strategies are needed, addressing barriers and facilitators of DPYD testing. &#xa9; 2025 The Author(s).

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives : Fluoropyrimidines are widely used chemotherapeutic agents in various solid tumors. Germline variants in the DPYD gene, which encodes the enzyme dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), are known to impair drug metabolism and increase the risk of severe toxicity. This umbrella review aims to synthesize the current evidence from systematic reviews on the association between DPYD variants and fluoropyrimidine-induced toxicity. Methods: A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library from inception to 2023, including gray literature. Systematic reviews assessing fluoropyrimidine toxicity in oncologic patients with DPYD variants were included. Study quality was assessed using the AMSTAR-2 tool. Registration number in PROSPERO: CRD42023401226. Results : Two independent investigators performed the study selection, quality assessment, and data collection. Eight systematic reviews met the inclusion criteria. Methodological confidence was rated as critically low in six, low in one, and medium in another one. The reviews included 125 primary studies, most of them focused on four key DPYD variants (DPYD2*A, DPYD*13, c.2846A&gt;T, and HapB3), all of which showed consistent associations with an increased risk of severe toxicity. Rare variants such as DPYD*4, *5, and *6 were also examined, though evidence remains limited. Pharmacogenetics-guided dosing of fluoropyrimidines significantly reduced toxicity rates in several studies. The integration of DPYD genotyping with phenotyping approaches faces limitations; these tests should complement rather than replace genotyping information. Conclusions : This umbrella review confirms the clinical relevance of DPYD genotyping to predict and mitigate fluoropyrimidine toxicity. Incorporating genotyping into clinical practice, potentially alongside phenotyping and therapeutic drug monitoring, may enhance patient safety and treatment efficacy.",

      "abstract": "Anticancer drug 5FU is extensively metabolized by dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), an enzyme with high interindividual variability. Poor metabolizer (PM, i.e., DPD deficient) patients are at risk of life-threatening toxicities. Whether ultra-rapid metabolizer (UM) status could conversely compromise 5FU efficacy remains to be investigated. In this real-world study, 352 adult patients treated with a 5FU-containing regimen were screened. Patients were classified as normal (extensive metabolizer, EM), PM, or UM on DPD function based upon baseline plasma uracil monitoring. The impact of DPD status on efficacy and safety endpoints was investigated. Patients were categorized on DPD as UM (11.9%), EM (75.9%), and PM (12.2%). The response rate was 54.5%, with median PFS and OS of 13.9 and 19&#x2009;months, respectively. PM patients were treated with an average 13% lower 5FU starting dose. There was no statistical difference in efficacy between UM and other patients. Severe toxicities were observed in less than 5% of patients, an incidence significantly lower than commonly reported with 5FU-containing regimen and was comparable between UM, EM, and PM patients. Our observations suggest that UM status is not associated with the lack of efficacy of 5FU. In addition, upfront DPD testing with adaptive dosing helps to reduce the incidence of severe toxicities, as PM patients on reduced doses did not have more severe toxicities than other patients treated with standard doses, while exhibiting similar efficacy in terms of response rate and survival. When upfront DPD screening with adaptive dosing is performed, no difference is observed between UM, EM, and PM patients in terms of efficacy and safety. #PADSA3GKW7. &#xa9; 2025 The Author(s).

      "abstract": "5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) and its pro-drug, capecitabine, are widely used to treat solid tumors. Patients with dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPYD) deficiency are at increased risk for severe treatment-related toxicity. This study reported the implementation of DPYD genotyping in clinical practice and assessed the impact of genotype-guided dosing on clinical outcomes. An in-house pharmacogenomic testing using the Elucigene DPYD genotyping kit (Yourgene Health, UK) was established to detect the four most common clinically actionable DPYD alleles, including *2A, *13, HapB3 and c.2846A&gt;T (rs67376798). Six months post-implementation, a retrospective chart review assessed genotype results, chemotherapy regimens, dose modifications, adverse events related to 5-FU or capecitabine, and demographics. Data were de-identified for analysis. Analytical validation of the DPYD assay showed 100&#xa0;% sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, reproducibility, and repeatability. The genotyping workflow was successfully integrated into clinical practice, with a rapid turnaround time to meet oncology treatment planning. From July to December 2024, 299 patients underwent DPYD testing; variants were identified in 22 patients, including 20 patients (6.7&#xa0;%) with clinically significant variants conferring a reduced DPD function and 2 patients with a variant (c.483&#xa0;+&#xa0;18G&gt;A; rs56276561) that retains normal DPD function. Among those variants, HapB3 (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;18) was the most frequent one, characterized by c.1129-5923C&gt;G and c.1236G&gt;A (rs75017182, rs56038477) co-occurring with c.483&#xa0;+&#xa0;18G&gt;A (rs56276561). Of 233 patients receiving 5-FU-based chemotherapy, 13 were variant carriers. Genotype-guided dosing allowed early dose optimization, and all carriers completed at least three treatment cycles, with one severe adverse event attributed to oxaliplatin rather than 5-FU. This study reported the integration of DPYD pharmacogenomic testing into oncology care and evaluated the post-implementation clinical outcomes, highlighting the critical role of pharmacogenomic testing in optimizing cancer treatment and improving patient safety.

      "title": "Severe toxicity following genotype-guided reduced 5-FU dose in a heterozygous DPYD c.2846A&gt;T carrier with stage III anal carcinoma: A case report.",
      "abstract": "Fluoropyrimidines (e.g., 5-fluorouracil, capecitabine) are antineoplastic agents commonly used in the setting of gastrointestinal cancer. Dihydropyridine dehydrogenase (DPD), encoded by the DPYD gene, is the enzyme responsible for up to 85% of 5-FU catabolism into inactive metabolites. Decreased or no function genetic variations in DPYD are rare but increase risk of potentially fatal adverse effects (e.g., myelosuppression) due to decreased metabolism of 5-FU. The extent of which DPD enzyme activity is impaired varies among individual decreased function DPYD variants. A 75-year-old female was diagnosed with stage III squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal. She was scheduled to receive therapy consisting of mitomycin C (8&#xa0;mg/m2) administered over 30&#xa0;min and continuous infusion 5-FU (4000&#xa0;mg/m2) over 96&#xa0;h for 2 cycles with concurrent radiotherapy. Prior to treatment, the patient underwent DPYD genotyping which revealed she was a heterozygous carrier of the decreased function allele, c.2846&#xa0;A&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;T. In accordance with Clinical Pharmacogenomics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guideline recommendations, the dose of 5-FU for cycle 1 was reduced by 50%. Despite the dose reduction, she still experienced mucositis (G3), neutropenia (G3), diarrhea (G2), nausea and vomiting (G2), and dyspnea (G2). This case report supports the clinical utility of pre-emptive DPYD genotyping to guide initial 5-FU dosing in intermediate metabolizers, and it suggests that all patients still require close monitoring and some (particularly carriers of c.2846&#xa0;A&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;T) may require an initial dose reduction greater than the recommended 50% to prevent severe toxicity. &#xa9; 2025.

      "title": "Clinical Implications of Dihydropyrimidine Dehydrogenase Deficiency in GI and Hepatopancreaticobiliary Cancers Treated With Fluoropyrimidines: A Prospective Observational Study.",
      "abstract": "Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency, an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder, causes a considerable deficit in the patient's metabolism of fluoropyrimidine drugs, most notably 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and capecitabine. There is a higher frequency of severe toxicities after a fluoropyrimidine regimen among patients with GI and hepatopancreaticobiliary (HPB) malignancies on chemotherapy because of this metabolic deficiency. This prospective study aims to assess the rate of DPD deficiency and clinical significance of DPD deficiency in patients receiving fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy at a tertiary oncology center in India. From March 2024 to February 2025, we prospectively recruited 146 patients with histologic confirmation of GI and HPB cancers who were commencing a 5-FU- or capecitabine-based regimen. We performed pretreatment DPD tests on all patients using TRUPCR DPYD reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for four known variants. Severe toxicities (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v5.0) were assessed after the first cycle of chemotherapy. Dose reductions, advances in therapy, and admissions were also noted. Of the 146 study participants, 11 (7.5%) had a DPYD mutation. HapB3 (rs56038477) was the most commonly encountered variant (72.7% of patients), along with registries of DPYD*2A (18.2%) mutation and mutation c.2846A&gt;T (9.1%). Severe toxicities (grade &#x2265;3) were above other grade toxicities (61.6%) in mutation carriers (72.7%) as compared with mutation noncarriers (37.0%, P = .03). Neutropenia, diarrhea, and thrombocytopenia were the common toxicities at a frequency of 18.5%, 12.3%, and 15.1%, respectively. After dose reduction, 90.9% of mutation carriers required a dose reduction versus 14.8% of mutation noncarriers ( P &lt; .001). Both groups had no problems in completing treatment. Individuals with DPYD mutations experience increased toxicity and dose adjustments; however, treatment efficacy was not affected. This indicates that a coordinated effort that incorporates routine DPYD testing can mitigate treatment toxicities and individualized fluoropyrimidine dosing for patients with GI and HPB cancers.",

      "abstract": ": Deleterious DPYD variants are the primary identified cause of severe fluoropyrimidine-related toxicity. The objective was to improve the sensitivity of current DPYD genotyping recommendations and develop a predictive model for severe toxicity. : This pooled analysis included colorectal cancer (CRC) patients from seven prospective studies. Full DPYD sequencing was performed. Depending on their minor allele frequency (MAF), relevant DPYD variants were identified using Bolasso, or SKAT coupled with in silico functionality predictions. The primary end-point was 12-week grade 4-5 fluoropyrimidine-related hematological and digestive toxicities. Multivariate logistic regression models were developed. Of 4,496 eligible patients, 3,437 were analyzed (267 events). The final model included patient/treatment characteristics, variants *2A/*13/p.D949V, common variants rs1801160 (p.V732I (*6), OR 1.93 [95%CI 1.37-2.70] if heterozygous) and rs2297595 (p.M166V, OR 1.49 [95%CI 1.13-1.96] if heterozygous), and aggregation of all very rare (MAF&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01) in silico-predicted deleterious variants (OR 3.20 [95%CI 1.43-7.14] if one allele). Model performance was supported by discrimination (AUC&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.76, 95%CI 0.73-0.78), calibration, and internal validation. Crude sensitivity of DPYD testing increased from 11.2% for *2A/*13/p.D949V to 47.5% when including the 44 variants. An exploratory analysis of 1,138 stage III CRC patients revealed, for the first time, that carriers of deleterious DPYD variants exhibited significantly longer overall survival: HR&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.65 [95%CI 0.43-0.98] for p. V732I and 0.62 [95%CI 0.43-0.90] for p. M166V. DPYD sequencing identified additional relevant variants and improved the sensitivity of DPYD testing.

      "title": "Implementing DPYD genotyping to predict chemotherapy toxicity in Australia: a feasibility study.",
      "abstract": "Implementing pharmacogenomic-guided management in cancer patients equitably and effectively in a large population presents challenges. DPYD genotyping determines clinically significant variants of patients at increased risk of developing grade3-5 fluoropyrimidine (FP) toxicity. FP chemotherapies are prescribed for ~16,000 Australians with a 10%-40% grade3-4 toxicity incidence and 1% mortality. Variant carriers can have FP dosing adjusted to improve treatment tolerance without compromising anticancer effect. This strategy has not been formally adopted within Australia, despite widespread international standardisation. This pilot study determined genotyping turnaround-times (TAT) for 4 DPYD variants (c.1905+1G&gt;A, c.1679T&gt;G, c.2846A&gt;T and c.1236G&gt;A/Haplotype B3) in Australian patients. Secondary objectives were identification of FP toxicities of DPYD variant carriers, and analysis of healthcare stakeholder perspectives, including enablers/barriers to implementation. Genotyping was determined by Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction. Qualitative data were determined through semi-structured questionnaire. 104 patients recruited over 24 months had a mean TAT of 7.2&#x2009;days, 5.2 business days (range 1-30). Grade3-4 toxicity occurred in 9/16 DPYD variant carriers, including 2 ICU admissions and 1 death. Themes from 30 questionnaire respondents suggest that clinical environment and resources were fundamental barriers, and motivation to improve patient care was the predominant enabler of change. DPYD genotyping is feasible for improving precision-oncology for patients requiring FP chemotherapies. A TAT of 7&#x2009;days is acceptable by both stakeholder respondents and national oncology clinician groups. This pilot study, although small, informs a large national project evaluating prospective DPYD genotyping and its impact on FP tolerability, patient safety and cost-effectiveness in Australia. &#xa9; 2025 Royal Australasian College of Physicians.",

Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD, gene DPYD) is the main enzyme responsible for fluoropyrimidine metabolism; genetic variation in the DPYD gene that reduce enzyme function may contribute to increased risk for fluoropyrimidine toxicity.

Whole-exome next generation sequencing was carried out in a retrospective study of 334 fluoropyrimidine-treated cancer patients to identify DPYD variants and potential association with severe toxicity. We identified 10 rare DPYD variants among 334 fluoropyrimidine-treated cancer patients that were wildtype for the pre-emptively tested variants.

      "title": "5-Fluorouracil (5-FU)-induced organ toxicities: mechanisms, management, and prevention strategies.",
      "abstract": "Fluoropyrimidines are a class of chemotherapy drugs used to treat various solid tumors. 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) an antimetabolite in the fluoropyrimidine family, which has shown remarkable efficacy against a variety of solid tumors, is a crucial medication in the treatment of cancer. However, severe organ toxicities frequently restrict its therapeutic potential. Our current knowledge of the intricate processes underlying 5-FU-induced toxicities, such as cellular absorption, metabolism, disruption of DNA synthesis, interference with RNA processing, and cell cycle regulation, is consolidated in this thorough study. 5-FU toxicity affects the cardiovascular, neurological, gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, hematological, and pulmonary systems and includes a number of mechanisms, including oxidative stress, inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction. With documented severe toxicity occurrences varying from 0.55% to 40% depending on the affected organ, genetic differences, especially in drug-metabolizing enzymes like dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), are important in predicting toxicity risk. Individual susceptibility to these toxicities has been found to be significantly influenced by patterns of polymorphism peculiar to a population. While new research points to the possible advantages of certain protective agents, current management approaches mostly focus on supportive care and dose modifications. Pharmacogenomic testing has demonstrated potential in lowering the risk of serious toxicities, particularly for variations in the DPYD gene. Improved therapy techniques, such as genetic profile-based individualized dosing and improved monitoring protocols, have been made possible by a clearer knowledge of these pathways.",

This study evaluates the incidences of severe fluoropyrimidine-related toxicity between wild-type patients and DPYD variant allele carriers in a real-world patient cohort. This retrospective, observational cohort study was conducted in adult patients with a first fluoropyrimidine-based anticancer therapy. Patients were genotyped for four function variants, DPYD*2A, C.1236G&gt;A, C.2846A&gt;T and DPYD*13. Dosing was according to international guidelines. The primary endpoint was the incidence of severe fluoropyrimidine-related toxicity. The secondary endpoint was to identify predictors for severe fluoropyrimidine-related toxicity. In total, 857 patients were included of which 71 were DPYD variant allele carriers. 27% of wild-type patients experienced severe fluoropyrimidine-related toxicity vs. 18% of variant allele carriers (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.11). For C.1236G&gt;A, the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) was 0.63 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.16-2.41) following a 25% dose reduction, and 0.39 (95% CI 0.13-1.18) following a 50% dose reduction. For C.2846A&gt;T, the aOR was 2.00 (95% CI 0.19-21.65) following a 25% dose reduction, and 1.18 (95% CI 0.22-6.53) following a 50% dose reduction. Significant independent predictors for toxicity were combination with oxaliplatin and docetaxel (aOR 10.67), oxaliplatin and irinotecan (aOR 4.66) and concurrent radiotherapy (aOR 0.18). DPYD genotype-based dosing resulted in comparable incidences of severe fluoropyrimidine-related toxicity between wild-type patients and DPYD variant allele carriers. The updated guideline recommendation on dosing of C.1236G&gt;A and C.2846A&gt;T variant carriers appears adequate from a toxicity perspective. Our findings highlight the need to perform an individual dose titration, especially in C.1236G&gt;A variant carriers. &#xa9; 2025 British Pharmacological Society.",
