# Title
Multiple Myeloma Digital Twin (RUO): Transparent in‑silico drug efficacy with provenance and cohort context

# Authors
Fahad Kiani (CrisPRO.ai)

# Abstract
[Paste from mmAbstract.mdc once finalized.]

# 1. Introduction
[Problem framing; prior art; contribution; RUO scope.]

# 2. Methods
## 2.1 Sequence (S)
[Evo2 scoring, bounded windows, Fusion AM gating, provenance.]
## 2.2 Pathway (P)
[Gene→pathway, MM weighting, drug-class mapping, badges.]
## 2.3 Evidence (E)
[ClinVar prior; literature (optional, cached); modest lifts.]
## 2.4 Insight Chips
[Functionality, Regulatory, Essentiality, Chromatin; calibration hooks.]
## 2.5 Cohort Overlays & Calibration
[Overlay signals; calibration snapshot service; reliability.]
## 2.6 Implementation
[Backend routers/services; FE components; provenance; toggles; reproducibility.]

# 3. Results
## 3.1 Cohort summary (T1)
[N, label distribution, coverage_by_gene, response per class.]
## 3.2 Performance (T2)
[AUROC/AUPRC per profile/drug class; CIs; p-values vs baselines.]
## 3.3 Ablations (T3)
[S/P/E/chips/Fusion lifts; runtime/cost.]
## 3.4 Calibration (F1)
[Reliability plots; thresholds.]
## 3.5 Decision Curves (F2, optional)
[Net benefit vs thresholds.]
## 3.6 Fusion coverage vs lift (F3)
## 3.7 Confidence/Tiers/Badges distributions (F4)
## 3.8 Chip distributions (F5)
## 3.9 Provenance schematic (F6)

# 4. Discussion
[Interpretation; RUO positioning; limits; roadmap (structure, SAE, evidence, cohort scale).]

# 5. Reproducibility
[Code/env; API schemas; scripts; run_ids for all figures; data availability/DUA/IRB notes.]

# 6. Ethics & Safety
[Viral exclusions; generation gates; RUO disclaimers.]

# 7. Conclusion
[Summary and impact; how users can run similar experiments in product.]

# References
[Include Evo2 figure/method citations and MM dataset references.]
