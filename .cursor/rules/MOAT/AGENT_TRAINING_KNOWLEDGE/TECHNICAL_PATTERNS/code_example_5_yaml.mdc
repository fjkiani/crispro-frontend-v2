# Code Example 5 (yaml)

**Category**: pattern
**Priority**: P2
**Source**: Chat log lines 156-241

---

      - Lead time analysis (how early kinetics detect)
      - Proof: Kinetics layer works for onset detection
    
    TIMELINE: 6-8 days (Jan 10-17)
  
  AGENT 3 (SCIENTIST):
    PARALLEL: Contact collaborators (S4 execution)
      - Email KELIM developers (biomarker-kinetics.org)
      - Contact Institut Curie (GCIG meta-analysis)
      - Reach out to GOG-218/ICON7 trial investigators
      - Request treatment cohort data
    
    DELIVERABLE: Collaborator outreach campaign
      - 5-10 emails sent
      - Response tracking (2-4 weeks typical)
      - Backup plan if all decline (Project Data Sphere)
    
    TIMELINE: 2-3 days (Jan 10-12)

IF PLCO NOT APPROVED YET:
  - Continue building harness (Agent 2)
  - Continue S4 execution (Agent 3)
  - Reassess Jan 10-12
```

### **Week 3-4 (Jan 17-31): Integration Phase**

SCENARIO A: PLCO Kinetics Validated + Collaborator Data Pending

  AGENT 2:
    - PLCO analysis complete (kinetics work for onset)
    - Proof-of-concept achieved
    - Wait for treatment cohort data
  
  AGENT 3:
    - Collaborator responses arriving (2-4 week lag)
    - Negotiating data access
    - Preparing data use agreements
  
  AGENT 1 (THERAPY FIT):
    ✅ NOW EXECUTE: WIWFM validation (Agent 1 plan)
      - TCGA-OV baseline mutations (469 patients) ✅ HAVE
      - Platinum response outcomes ✅ HAVE
      - Validate DDR → PARP (pathway alignment)
      - Validate MAPK → MEK (pathway alignment)
      - Target: 90%+ pathway alignment (like MM validation)
    
    TIMELINE: 2-3 weeks (Jan 17 - Feb 7)
    OWNER: Agent 3 (scientist) OR separate agent

SCENARIO B: PLCO Kinetics Failed (<0.60 AUROC)

  HONEST ASSESSMENT:
    - Kinetics alone insufficient for screening cohort
    - Possible reasons: Too sparse, wrong kinetic window
    - Learn from failure: Document why
  
  PIVOT:
    - Still pursue treatment cohorts (different biology)
    - Focus on WIWFM validation (proven framework)
    - Deprioritize Resistance Prophet (needs better data)

SCENARIO C: Treatment Cohort Data Acquired

  AGENT 2 + AGENT 3:
    - TRUE Resistance Prophet validation
    - MAPK + CA-125 for resistance timing
    - Target: AUROC 0.65-0.75
    - Timeline: 2-3 weeks after data arrival
  
  WIWFM:
    - Execute in parallel OR after RP validation
```
