    ❓ WHY does recruitment collapse?
       • Chemokines lost?
       • Physical barriers?
       • Vascular collapse?
       • Suppressor cells?
    
    ❓ WHICH tumors need WHICH intervention?
    
    ❓ CAN we rescue collapsed recruitment?

## **PRESENTATION SCRIPT (2-MINUTE VERSION)**

**SLIDE 1:**
> "Dr. Pauken, your IV timestamp tool is the first method in the world to track T-cell recruitment in real-time. You've proven fresh recruits are fitter, recruitment collapses over time, and anti-PD-1's primary mechanism is DOUBLING fresh T-cell influx—not just waking up exhausted cells."

**SLIDE 2:**
> "But 70-80% of checkpoint patients still fail. You can MEASURE recruitment collapse—but you don't know WHY. Is it chemokines? Physical barriers? Vascular collapse? Suppressors? Without diagnosis, you can't design the RIGHT rescue."

**SLIDE 3:**
> "CrisPRO offers a Bottleneck Diagnostic. Give us your RNA-seq + timestamp data, and we'll classify tumors into 4 types—then design precision interventions. Type A gets chemokine overexpression. Type B gets stromal remodeling. Type C gets suppressor neutralization. Type D gets vascular normalization. Not one solution—FOUR."

**SLIDE 4:**
> "Full transparency: We're TESTING this. Our design tools are validated—but we don't know if bulk RNA-seq can predict your timestamp measurements. Literature baseline is r = 0.3-0.5. We're betting we can hit r > 0.60 with your gold-standard data. If we fail, we pivot to spatial RNA-seq—or document what DOESN'T work. Either way, you get designs + code."

**SLIDE 5:**
> "The pilot is 8 weeks, $0 cost, 30 samples. Week 1-2: data transfer. Week 3-4: train classifier, test if RNA predicts bottlenecks. Week 5-6: design 5 interventions. Week 7-8: deliver heatmap, gene signature, anti-PD-1 predictor, designs, validation protocols. If r > 0.60, we publish together. If r < 0.50, we recommend spatial and you keep everything."

**SLIDE 6:**
> "What you get: A pre-treatment biomarker to enrich clinical trials. Four precision therapeutic designs. Co-authorship on Nature Immunology and Nature Medicine papers. Joint IP with 70/30 split. And a learning system—your validation experiments improve our models, compounding your advantage."

**SLIDE 7:**
> "Why now? Your timestamp discovery is novel—this is your window to capture the data moat before others build competing classifiers. The checkpoint market is saturated—combination products are the differentiator. And 70% of patients are failing—every 8-week delay costs lives. This partnership turns your measurement breakthrough into medicine."

## **EMAIL-READY SUMMARY (PASTE INTO MESSAGE)**

**Subject:** Partnership Proposal: T-Cell Recruitment Engineering (MD Anderson + CrisPRO)

**Body:**

Dr. Pauken,

Your IV timestamp tool is the first method to track T-cell recruitment in real-time. You've proven recruitment collapses (Day 10 → Day 25) and that anti-PD-1 DOUBLES fresh T-cell influx. This is breakthrough science.

**The Gap:** You can MEASURE recruitment collapse—but don't know WHY (chemokines? barriers? vessels? suppressors?). Without diagnosis, can't design precision rescue.

**Our Proposal:** 8-week pilot, $0 cost, 30 tumors (RNA-seq + timestamp data)
- **DIAGNOSE:** RNA-seq → bottleneck classification (Type A/B/C/D)
- **DESIGN:** 4 precision interventions (one per bottleneck type)
- **PREDICT:** Anti-PD-1 response biomarker (pre-treatment)

**Deliverables:**
1. Bottleneck heatmap for all 30 tumors
2. Gene signature (top 20 genes predicting recruitment collapse)
3. 5 intervention designs with validation protocols
4. Calibration report (r-value, performance metrics)

**Hypothesis:** Bulk RNA-seq predicts bottlenecks (target: r > 0.60; lit baseline: r = 0.3-0.5)  
**Pivot Plan:** If r < 0.50, recommend spatial RNA-seq and re-train

**Cost:** $0. Co-author + co-own IP if it works. You keep everything if it fails.

**Value:** De-risk your next 3 years of experiments. Turn measurement into medicine.

Attached: 7-slide visual deck outlining pilot, deliverables, and partnership terms.

Can we schedule 60 minutes to discuss?
