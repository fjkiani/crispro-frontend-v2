# Core Product Pitch Deck – Doctrine & Build Guide

Purpose: Provide a slide-by-slide outline for a core product pitch deck, with the exact messages, proof points, visuals, and live-demo hooks. Another agent should be able to assemble the deck and run the live demo using this rule.

RUO posture: Research-use only. No clinical claims. Provenance and disclaimers must be visible.

## Audience and Goal
- Audience: Investors, strategic partners, biotech R&D leaders
- Goal: Show a credible, demo-complete in‑silico therapeutic design and validation platform with clear value, traction path, and moats.

## Narrative Arc (30–35 min)
1) The Problem → 2) The Solution → 3) How It Works → 4) Live Demo → 5) Evidence & Metrics → 6) Business & Moats → 7) Roadmap & Ask

## Slide Outline (with assets & demo hooks)

1. Title – CrisPRO.ai: In‑Silico Therapeutic Co‑Pilot (Research‑mode)
- Message: Predict, generate, and validate therapeutic hypotheses in software.
- Visual: Product hero screenshot (Myeloma Digital Twin). RUO disclaimer.
- Hook: “We’ll run a live demo in a few slides.”

2. The Problem – Slow, expensive, low‑signal validation
- Message: Drug response hypotheses take months; data is fragmented; results are brittle.
- Proof: Cite high-level industry stats (time/cost), absence of cohort context in tooling.
- Visual: Before/after timeline.

3. Our Solution – In‑Silico Co‑Pilot
- Message: One orchestrated flow from variant → insight → efficacy → cohort support.
- Visual: S/P/E diagram + Orchestrator block.
- Hook: “We turn DNA into clear guidance with audit trails.”

4. How It Works (System)
- Message: S/P/E fusion with Evo2 and AlphaMissense, session and caching, provenance.
- Visual: Architecture map: FE pages ↔ FastAPI ↔ Evo/Fusion ↔ Redis/Supabase.
- Links: [insights.py](mdc:oncology-coPilot/oncology-backend-minimal/api/routers/insights.py), [efficacy.py](mdc:oncology-coPilot/oncology-backend-minimal/api/routers/efficacy.py), [fusion.py](mdc:oncology-coPilot/oncology-backend-minimal/api/routers/fusion.py)

5. Live Demo Setup – What you’ll see
- Message: 3-part demo – MM WIWFM → VUS Explorer → Dossier + Cohort Lab.
- Technical: Local backend at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`, `VITE_API_ROOT` configured, Redis optional.
- Endpoints: `/api/efficacy/predict`, `/api/insights/*`, `/api/datasets/extract_and_benchmark`.

6. Demo Part 1 – “Will It Work For Me?” (Myeloma)
- Message: Ranked therapies with score, confidence, evidence tier, insights chips.
- Visual: Live UI with badges and rationale.
- Hook: Confidence reflects evidence + sequence disruption; provenance visible.
- Endpoint: `POST /api/efficacy/predict`

7. Demo Part 2 – VUS Explorer
- Message: Unknown variants → four clear signals (Functionality, Regulatory, Essentiality, Chromatin).
- Visual: InsightChips + CoverageChips; Fusion eligibility chip (AM coverage).
- Endpoint: `/api/insights/predict_*`, `/api/fusion/coverage`, `/api/evidence/clinvar`

8. Demo Part 3 – Target Dossier
- Message: Simple, auditable dossier: insights, rationale, provenance, cohort context.
- Visual: Dossier with CohortSummary.
- Endpoint: `/api/datasets/extract_and_benchmark` (coverage-by-gene)

9. Cohort Lab – Extract, Label, Benchmark
- Message: In-product cohort creation and HRD AUPRC benchmarks.
- Visual: CohortLab panel + metrics card.
- Scripts/Endpoint: [hrd_platinum_auprc.py](mdc:tools/benchmarks/hrd_platinum_auprc.py), `/api/datasets/extract_and_benchmark`

10. Evidence & Provenance – Trust by design
- Message: Every result has run_id, feature flags, methods, citations.
- Visual: ProvenanceBar; response snippet showing `provenance`.
- Feature: Literature is toggleable; deep-analysis path still yields confident rankings.

11. Accuracy & KPIs – What we measure
- Message: Report AUPRC/AUROC for HRD baseline; show lift plan with Fusion + richer S.
- KPIs: time-to-result, cache hit rate, $/1k variants, confidence distribution.
- Acceptance: Deterministic results under baseline profile.

12. Security, Compliance, RUO
- Message: Research‑use only; audit trails; no PHI; aggregate cohort stats only.
- Visual: Compliance checklist.

13. Business Model & IP Royalty Doctrine (Brief)
- Message: Platform co‑invention and royalty rails (future phases).
- Visual: 2‑slide summary; full doctrine in appendix.
- Details:
  - Platform royalty: 2–5% of licensing revenue when AI contribution is substantial.
  - Co‑inventor ownership: 10–30% patent ownership for AI‑generated compositions (case‑dependent).
  - Service + royalty hybrid: $50K–$200K filing assistance + 1–3% backend.
  - Clear disclosure of AI assistance; provenance and inventor contribution tracking.
  - RUO: all capabilities shown as research‑mode; no clinical claims.
  - Note: Full doctrine captured in internal rules; summarize only in deck.

14. Competitive Landscape & Moats
- Message: Orchestrated S/P/E with auditability; cohort integration; session + caching.
- Visual: Capability matrix; our moats (data, orchestration, provenance).

15. Go‑To‑Market
- Message: Research labs and biotech pilots; onboarding with demo-complete MM flow.
- Visual: Pilot timeline; success criteria.

16. Roadmap
- Message: Expand to HRD/DDR; enrich evidence; knowledge base; session persistence; Web3 provenance.
- Visual: Quarter-by-quarter map; feature flags/profiles.

17. Traction & Partnerships (if available)
- Message: Early pilots, datasets processed, benchmarks run.
- Visual: Logos / anonymized study stats.

18. Ask & Next Steps
- Message: Funding/partner asks, milestones, hiring.
- CTA: “See extended demo or schedule technical deep‑dive.”

## Demo Runbook (1‑pager)
- Backend: `uvicorn api.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000` (ensure `api/main.py` indentation fixed)
- Env flags: `EVO_FORCE_MODEL=evo2_1b`, `EVO_USE_DELTA_ONLY=1`, `DISABLE_LITERATURE=1`, optional `DISABLE_FUSION=1`
- Redis (optional): `docker run -p 6379:6379 redis:7`
- Sanity checks:
  - `GET /openapi.json` → 200
  - `POST /api/efficacy/predict` (BRAF V600E example) → ranked drugs returned
  - `POST /api/insights/predict_gene_essentiality` → score ∈ [0,1], `provenance` present
  - `POST /api/datasets/extract_and_benchmark` → metrics JSON

## Endpoint Map (Deck → Live)
- WIWFM: `POST /api/efficacy/predict`
- Insights: `POST /api/insights/predict_*`
- Fusion coverage (AM): `GET /api/fusion/coverage`
- ClinVar prior: `GET /api/evidence/clinvar`
- Cohort Lab: `POST /api/datasets/extract_and_benchmark`
- Knowledge Base (optional): `GET /api/kb/*`

## Visual Assets Checklist
- Architecture diagram (S/P/E + Orchestrator + Caching)
- Screenshots: Myeloma, VUS Explorer, Dossier, Cohort Lab
- Provenance snippet and chips (Functionality/Chromatin/Essentiality/Regulatory)
- KPI cards (AUPRC/AUROC, confidence)

## Speaker Notes (per demo section)
- Emphasize RUO and auditability (provenance)
- Call out safety gates and deterministic checks (Triumvirate)
- Explain profiles: Baseline vs Richer S vs Fusion
- Connect to business value: faster hypotheses, cheaper iteration, clearer confidence

## Failover Plan (Live)
- If Evo upstream is unavailable: keep Baseline profile; show cached responses and provenance
- If Redis down: disable vector search/caching; inform via developer banner
- If dataset endpoint slow: show precomputed CohortSummary artifact

## Metrics & Logging (for answers during Q&A)
- Cache hit rate, response times, error rate
- Model profile used (1B baseline)
- Upstream dependency reachability (Evo/Fusion)
