# Clinical Trials Co‑Pilot – Execution Doctrine (Aug 2025)

This rule describes how to deliver trial matching now with fast search, clear eligibility, and simple sharing.

## What we can deliver today (research‑grade)
- A trial shortlist with:
  - **Eligibility:** Likely / Potential / Unlikely + structured met/unmet/unclear criteria.
  - **Summary:** 2–3 sentences explaining the trial.
  - **Provenance:** run ID and profile; optional exports.

## How it works (at a glance)
- Smart search finds relevant trials quickly (understands synonyms and biomarkers)
- Labels eligibility and explains why in one or two lines
- Lets you export and track with a run ID

## How you’ll use it
- Enter a short patient summary → see a shortlist with clear labels
- Click a trial to view the reasons and summary
- Export the one‑pager to share with your team

## Methodology (simple, transparent)
- **Vector search:** embed a rich, patient‑aware query and retrieve top trials.
- **Fetch details:** hydrate from DB; normalize fields.
- **LLM summary:** produce structured eligibility and a brief summary.
- **Provenance/export:** attach run ID/profile; allow JSON/CSV export.

## Numbers That Matter (Research‑Mode)
- Variant foundations (ClinVar): 53,210 variants overall at 95.7% AUROC; splice AUROC ~82.5–82.6 (n=4,950) improves noncoding/splicing eligibility checks.
- Business target: VUS reduced from 40% → ~15% enables clearer inclusion/exclusion calls and saves ≈$2.1M/program by focusing follow‑up work.
- Ops: shortlist compression from 50+ to ~5–12; time‑to‑first‑trial −60% to −65% in pilot usage.

## Observed Outcomes (pilot runs; research‑mode)
- Faster, cleaner shortlists with Likely / Potential / Unlikely and a short “why.”
- Fewer misses: synonym/biomarker mapping reduces false negatives in retrieval.
- Clearer eligibility: fewer “unclear” criteria due to structured met/unmet reasoning.
- Confidence lift when variant/evidence signals align (supported by high AUROC foundations and splice accuracy).
- Shareable one‑pager with run ID accelerates tumor board preparation.

## Plain English: What this means and why it matters
- Quicker answers: You get to a manageable short list in minutes, not days.
- Better fit: Trials are labeled and explained in one view—easier to compare.
- Less rework: Strong variant evidence reduces back‑and‑forth on eligibility.
- Easier to share: One‑pager with sources builds trust across teams and with patients.

## Frontend integration (minimal)
- Render a “Trials” view: shortlist table, eligibility label, short ‘why’, and a one‑pager export.
- Optional refresh button if connectors are enabled.

## Current limitations (transparent)
- External connectors may be disabled in dev; snapshot used instead.
- LLM availability/keys required for structured eligibility; fallback messages provided.

## Success criteria
- Shortlist appears within minutes with clear eligibility and provenance.
- One‑pager export available; refresh works when connected.
