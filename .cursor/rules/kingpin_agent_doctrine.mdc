Project Plan: Forging the Predator Module
1.0 Mission Objective
To re-platform the flawed run_predator_protocol.py script into a single, unified, and doctrinally sound workflow within the CommandCenter. This new module will be the definitive, end-to-end weapon system for autonomous therapeutic design.

2.0 Doctrinal Imperative: Annihilate Chaos
Let me be crystal fucking clear. The run_predator_protocol.py script and its associated tools will be deleted. All logic will be centralized. The UI will issue a single command, and the CommandCenter will execute the entire conquest.

3.0 The Plan of Attack
Phase I: Forge the CommandCenter Workflow
Objective: To create a new, primary endpoint that orchestrates the entire Predator Protocol from within our central command.

[ ] Task 1.1: Create the /workflow/execute_predator_protocol Endpoint.

Action: Create a new, powerful workflow in services/command_center/main.py.

Input: It will accept a single, high-level command: { "target_gene_symbol": "VEGFA" }.

[ ] Task 1.2: Implement the "Hunter-Killer" Kill Chain.

Action: This new workflow will autonomously execute the entire, corrected kill chain.

The New in silico Campaign Logic:

The Hunt (Automated Reconnaissance): The CommandCenter will first execute our Hunter-Analyst Agent logic, querying internal and external databases to identify the most vulnerable TARGET_MOTIF within the specified gene.

The Ambush (Guided Generation): It will then take the identified motif and execute our superior "Ambush Protocol." It will forge the bait_sequence and dispatch it as a direct prompt to our Unified Zeta Oracle's generate action, creating a slate of high-potential inhibitor candidates.

The Triage (Oracle Validation): Each candidate will then be run back through the Unified Zeta Oracle's score action to get a definitive "Stability Score."

The Confirmation Kill (Bio-Physical—FOR FUTURE DEPLOYMENT): The dependency on Boltz-2 is removed. The top candidate from the Triage phase is the final weapon for this version. Biophysical simulation will be a future enhancement.

Output: A single, rank-ordered list of fully validated therapeutic candidates.

Phase II: Forge the Command Deck (UI Integration)
Objective: To create a simple, powerful interface in the CrisPRO Studio for commanding this new weapon system.

[ ] Task 2.1: Build the "Predator Protocol" UI.

Action: Create a new page or module in our front-end application: "The Predator Protocol: Autonomous Therapeutic Design."

Note for Zo: The UI will have a single input field (Target Gene) and a single, glorious button: "UNLEASH PREDATOR."

[ ] Task 2.2: Implement Real-Time Mission Tracking.

Action: The UI will not be a static loading screen. It will provide a real-time log of the campaign as it unfolds.

Note for Zo: The UI will display the status of each phase: [HUNT PHASE: Acquiring Target...] -> [AMBUSH PHASE: Forging Candidates...] -> [TRIAGE PHASE: Validating Candidates...] -> [MISSION COMPLETE]. This provides undeniable proof of the power and complexity of the weapon we have unleashed.

This is the plan. It is disciplined, scalable, and doctrinally sound. It transforms a chaotic mess into a precision-guided weapon. Execute. 🚀
