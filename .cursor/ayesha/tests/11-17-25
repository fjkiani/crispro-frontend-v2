Metastatic adenocarcinoma consistent with Mullerian origin, see comment.
Comment: Similar tumor is identified in all parts. Tumor stains positive for PAX8, CK7, WT-1, and negative
for CK20, SATB2, GATA3. Per cytology report, tumor is negative for calretinin, and positive for MOC31 and
Claudin4. This immunoprofile is consistent with a carcinoma of Mullerian origin. Strong WT-1 staining is
more commonly seen in high grade serous carcinoma of adnexal or primary peritoneal origin than
endometrial primary. Please correlate with clinical findings.
Case was reviewed by additional members of the department.

Summary of biomarkers by immunohistochemical stain:
1. MMR (Mismatch repair protein expression): Preserved.
Positive staining for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, MSH6.
2. Hormone receptors:
ER (Estrogen receptor): Weakly positive, 50%
PR (Progesterone receptor): Negative (rare positive tumor cells, <1%).
3. p53: Positive, favor mutant type.
4. HER-2: Negative for over-expression, score 0.
5. FOLR1 (Folate receptor alpha): negative
<1% of tumor cells with membranous, dot-like cytoplasmic or luminal border staining.
Per current literature, cases wih staining in at least 75% of tumor cells are considered positive and eligible for treatment with
ELAHERE.
6. PD-L1 22C3: positive
CPS (combined positive score: PD-L1 positive tumor cells with complete or partial membranous staining
and PD-L1 positive infiltrating immune cells (lymphocytes and macrophages), divided by total number of
viable tumor cells, multiplied by 100): 10
 Possible reference range:
 No PD-L1 expression: <1
 Pd-L1 expression: >1
7. NTRK: Negative.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
The specimen is received in 4 parts:
Part A is received unfixed for frozen section evaluation in a container labeled with the patient's name, MRN, and "omental
biopsy". It consists of a 4.0 x 1.4 x 0.5 cm portion of yellow and red soft tissue. On palpation multiple (greater than 3) firm
and rubbery nodules are identified ranging from less than 0.1-0.2 cm in greatest dimension. The cut surface of the nodules
are uniformly solid and tan-white. The specimen is entirely submitted in 2 cassettes as follows:
AFS nodules at frozen
A1 remainder of specimen at permanent
Part B is received unfixed in a container labeled with the patient's name, MRN, and "endometrial curretings". It consists of
a 2.5 x 2.1 x 0.5 cm aggregate of mucoid material admixed with clotted blood. The specimen is filtered and submitted in
toto in one cassette labeled B1.
Part C is received unfixed in a container labeled with the patient's name, MRN, and "anterior perineal nodule". It consists of
a 1.8 x 1.2 x 0.7 cm piece of yellow and red soft tissue. On palpation a 0.6 cm in greatest dimension nodule is identified.
The specimen is submitted in toto in one cassette labeled C1.
Part D is received unfixed in a container labeled with the patient's name, MRN, and "omental biopsy #2". It consists of a 5.4
x 5.0 x 2.4 cm aggregate of yellow and red soft tissue. On palpation multiple (greater than 10) firm and rubbery nodules are
identified ranging from 0.2-0.4 cm. The specimen is section and representatively submitted in 2 cassettes labeled D1-D2.
