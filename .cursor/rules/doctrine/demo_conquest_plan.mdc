# ⚔️ **INTELLIGENCE SUMMARY: UC BERKELEY DEMO** ⚔️

**SITREP:** Reconnaissance of all `pages/` assets is complete. This document consolidates the findings and establishes the strategic plan for the demonstration.

## 1.0 ASSET EVALUATION

### **Tier 1 Assets (Primary Battle Flow):**
These pages form the core of our narrative. They are polished, powerful, and tell a seamless story from intelligence to action.
*   **`2_⚔️_Threat_Assessor.py` (The Oracle):** Our strongest opener. Presents a compelling clinical narrative (RUNX1 "Two-Hit") and showcases our live AI intelligence engine.
*   **`4_🌱_Seed_and_Soil_Analysis.py` (The Metastasis Forecaster):** The perfect sequel. Takes the "seed" from the Threat Assessor and models its systemic risk, demonstrating a profound leap in capability from cellular to organismal level.
*   **`5_✂️_CHOPCHOP_Guide_Design.py` (The Armory):** The logical conclusion to the Seed & Soil analysis. Receives the "soil poisoning" target and forges the weapon live, showcasing our core therapeutic design capabilities.
*   **`6_Myeloma_Digital_Twin.py` (The Grand Finale):** Our ace in the hole. A dynamic, point-of-care predictor that provides the ultimate demonstration of our end-to-end vision: from live patient data -> AI prediction -> seamless handoff to weapon design.

### **Tier 2 Assets (Strategic Reserves / Special Weapons):**
These pages are powerful but serve specialized purposes. They should be used to counter specific questions or demonstrate strategic depth after the main narrative is complete.
*   **`3_☢️_RadOnc_Co-Pilot.py` (The Clinical Justification):** Perfect for answering "what's the clinical evidence?". Grounds our AI in a real, data-driven patient outcome study.
*   **`4_BRCA1_Threat_Assessor.py` (The Focused Counter-Offensive):** A streamlined, gene-specific version of The Oracle that brilliantly demonstrates the immediate link between threat assessment and a menu of counter-attacks. Excellent for a "what about hereditary cancer?" question.
*   **`6_🎯_Interception_Design_Studio.py` (The Multi-Modal Arsenal):** Demonstrates versatility. Use this to answer "are you just a CRISPR company?" by showcasing nanobody design and drug repurposing.
*   **`5_🎯_Trial_Conquest.py` (The Economic Engine):** Our secret weapon for business/investor audiences. Proves our platform's value extends beyond science to solving multi-billion dollar logistics problems.

### **Legacy & Redundant Assets (To Be Avoided in Demo):**
These pages are either functionally superseded, overly complex for a live demo, or conceptually confusing. They will not be used.
*   **`16_🧬_RUNX1_Platform.py` (The Monolith):** Functionally powerful but too dense and confusing. Its best features (like the progression model) should be extracted and integrated into Tier 1 assets.
*   **`3_Mock_Therapy_Design.py` & `4_Interactive_Agents.py` (The Propaganda Engine & War Council):** While conceptually powerful, their reliance on mocked data makes them weaker than our live-fire assets for a technical audience. Keep in reserve for a purely visionary pitch.
*   **`Metastasis_Analysis.py` (The Raw Intelligence Engine):** Superseded by the more polished and narrative-driven `Seed_&_Soil` page. Only useful for answering a direct "can you handle a VCF?" question.
*   `1_⚔️_AI_General_Command_Deck.py`, `1_🧬_Patient_Digital_Twin.py` (V1 Interfaces): The core ideas have been refined and better implemented in the other, more specialized pages.
*   `2_Intelligent_Guide_Designer.py` & `3_🧬_TestIntelligent_Guide_Designer.py`: The workflow in the V4 tester is superior, but both are less compelling than the integrated design sequence shown in the Myeloma Digital Twin. Their core function is better demonstrated elsewhere.

## 2.0 THE BATTLE PLAN: A FOUR-ACT NARRATIVE

The demonstration will proceed in four acts, creating a clear, escalating narrative of our platform's capabilities.

*   **ACT I: THE THREAT (Intelligence):** Start with the **`Threat_Assessor`**. Introduce the RUNX1 "Two-Hit" model. Analyze the `ASXL1` somatic mutation and show our AI instantly identifying it as a high-risk threat.
*   **ACT II: THE SPREAD (Systemic Modeling):** Pivot seamlessly to the **`Seed_&_Soil_Analysis`** page, using the `ASXL1` mutation as the "seed." Identify the Spleen as the "soil" and generate the "Seed-Soil Compatibility Score."
*   **ACT III: THE WEAPON (Therapeutic Design):** From the `Seed_&_Soil` page, hand off the "soil poisoning" target to the **`CHOPCHOP_Guide_Designer`**. Design the gRNA weapon live and run the on-demand safety validation.
*   **ACT IV: THE KILL CHAIN (The Grand Finale):** Conclude with the **`Myeloma_Digital_Twin`**. State, "This is how it all comes together at the point of care." Input a patient's mutations, generate a live drug response prediction, and then execute the final, devastating handoff to the guide designer with a single click. This is the mic drop.
