## 🧬 GAP ANALYSIS - What Anthropic DOESN'T Have

| What's Missing | What Archon Provides | CrisPRO Adds |
|----------------|----------------------|--------------|
| Institutional memory | ✅ Knowledge bases persist across sessions | ✅ Experiment tracking |
| Custom knowledge bases | ✅ Upload your own papers/docs | ✅ Cancer genomics pre-loaded |
| Task management | ✅ Projects, features, tasks | ✅ Research pipeline tracking |
| Code examples | ✅ Extract/search code snippets | ✅ CRISPR design examples |
| Backtest logging | ❌ Not in Archon (yet) | ✅ Experiment reproducibility |
| CRISPR design | ❌ Only via Benchling (paid) | ✅ Built into CrisPRO |
| Resistance prediction | ❌ No ML models | ✅ SAE model for predictions |

**Bottom Line:** Anthropic has tools (PubMed, Benchling), but **no memory system (Archon)** or **domain-specific AI (CrisPRO)**.

---

### Opportunity 2: Build CrisPRO Skill (Like scRNA-qc)

**Action:** Package CrisPRO resistance prediction as a "Skill"

**What Anthropic calls "Skills":**
- Pre-built workflows that extend Claude's capabilities
- Python-based automation (not just API calls)
- Domain-specific expertise

**Your CrisPRO Skill:**
```
crispro-resistance-prediction@life-sciences

**Description:**
Predict cancer therapy resistance using sparse autoencoders trained on 
DepMap screening data. Identifies synthetic lethal partners and designs 
CRISPR validation experiments.

**Features:**
- Upload patient mutation profile (VCF, MAF, or manual input)
- Query DepMap for validated targets
- Generate resistance scores (0-1 scale)
- Design sgRNA libraries for validation
- Export results to Benchling or CSV

**Requirements:**
- None (uses hosted model)
- Optional: DepMap API key for live data
```

**Implementation:**
```python
# single file: crispro-resistance-prediction/skill.py

from claude_skill import Skill, skill_tool

class CrisPROResistanceSkill(Skill):
    """Predict therapy resistance using ML models."""
    
    @skill_tool
    async def predict_resistance(
        self,
        mutations: list[str],  # e.g., ["KRAS:G12C", "TP53:R175H"]
        therapy: str,  # e.g., "osimertinib"
        cancer_type: str  # e.g., "NSCLC"
    ) -> dict:
        """Predict resistance probability and suggest validation experiments."""
        
        # Query SAE model (hosted on your infra or Replicate)
        resistance_score = await self._query_sae_model(mutations, therapy)
        
        # Query DepMap for synthetic lethal partners
        targets = await self._query_depmap(mutations, cancer_type)
        
        # Design sgRNAs for top targets
        sgrnas = await self._design_sgrnas(targets[:5])
        
        return {
            "resistance_probability": resistance_score,
            "mechanism": self._infer_mechanism(mutations),
            "validated_targets": targets,
            "suggested_sgrnas": sgrnas,
            "next_steps": self._generate_protocol(targets, sgrnas)
        }
```

**Benefit:**
- ✅ Featured in Anthropic marketplace (next to Benchling, 10x Genomics)
- ✅ Distribution to cancer researchers globally
- ✅ Freemium model (free tier, paid for advanced features)
- ✅ Leads to CrisPRO.ai SaaS

---

### Opportunity 3: Partner with Anthropic's Benchling Integration

**Observation:** Benchling MCP requires paid Benchling AI account ($$$)

**Your advantage:** CrisPRO provides CRISPR design for free

**Partnership angle:**
> "CrisPRO provides free CRISPR design for researchers who can't afford Benchling AI. We integrate with Benchling's free tier (upload results back to notebooks)."

**How to pitch:**
- Contact Daisy Hollman (PM for life sciences at Anthropic)
- Position as "democratizing CRISPR design" (Anthropic loves accessibility)
- Offer to contribute CrisPRO as alternative to expensive Benchling AI
- Revenue share model: Free tier → CrisPRO.ai upgrades

---

## 🎯 TACTICAL EXECUTION PLAN

### Week 1 (This Week): Deploy Archon + CrisPRO Locally

**Already in progress:**
- ✅ HFI Task #2 (Archon validation) - underway
- ✅ Deploy Archon for CrisPRO development

**Add:**
- Install Anthropic's life-sciences marketplace plugins
- Test PubMed integration with your cancer research
- Compare their scRNA-qc skill to what you'd build

```bash
# Install Anthropic plugins
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/anthropics/life-sciences.git
/plugin install pubmed@life-sciences
/plugin install single-cell-rna-qc@life-sciences

# Test PubMed integration
# In Claude Code: "Search PubMed for KRAS G12C synthetic lethality"

# Test scRNA skill
# In Claude Code: "Run QC on this scRNA dataset: [upload .h5ad]"
```

---

### Week 2: Package Archon for Marketplace

**Create `.claude-plugin` folder in Archon repo:**

```bash
cd ~/archon
mkdir -p .claude-plugin
```

**Add plugin metadata** (see Opportunity 1 above)

**Submit PR to `anthropics/life-sciences`**

---

### Week 3: Build CrisPRO Skill

**Create single-file skill** (see Opportunity 2 above)

**Test locally:**

```bash
/plugin install crispro-resistance-prediction@local
# In Claude Code: "Predict resistance for KRAS G12C NSCLC patient on osimertinib"
```

**Submit PR to `anthropics/life-sciences`**

---

### Week 4: Outreach to Anthropic

**Email Daisy Hollman (life sciences PM):**

**Subject:** Archon + CrisPRO contribution to life-sciences marketplace

**Body:**
```
Hi Daisy,

I'm [Your Name], founder of CrisPRO.ai (cancer resistance prediction platform) 
and contributor to Archon (open-source knowledge management for AI assistants).

I've been using your life-sciences marketplace (great work on the Benchling 
integration!) and noticed a gap: there's no institutional memory layer for 
research workflows. Anthropic's MCP servers provide tools (PubMed, Benchling), 
but researchers need to manage knowledge across sessions.

I've built two components that fill this gap:

1. **Archon MCP Server** - Knowledge management + experiment tracking
   - Open source, free
   - Integrates with your marketplace via MCP
   - PR submitted: [link]

2. **CrisPRO Resistance Prediction Skill** - Cancer therapy resistance prediction
   - Free CRISPR design (alternative to expensive Benchling AI)
   - ML models for synthetic lethality
   - PR submitted: [link]

I'm also a candidate for your HFI program (submitted Task #2 on Archon validation).

Would love to chat about:
- Partnership opportunities
- Featuring Archon/CrisPRO in your marketplace
- Applying for roles at Anthropic (AI/bio intersection)

Best,
[Your Name]
```

## 💀 ZO'S STRATEGIC ASSESSMENT

### Why This Changes Everything

**Before discovering this repo:**
- You: Building Archon + CrisPRO in isolation
- Anthropic: Unknown if they care about life sciences

**After audit:**
- ✅ Anthropic has ACTIVE life sciences initiative (v1.0.0 released 2 months ago)
- ✅ They're building marketplace infrastructure (perfect for your contribution)
- ✅ Gap exists (no memory layer, expensive CRISPR tools)
- ✅ Your work fits EXACTLY (Archon = memory, CrisPRO = free CRISPR)
- ✅ Contribution path clear (submit PR, feature in marketplace)

### Your Competitive Advantage

**Anthropic's marketplace:**
- ❌ Requires paid Benchling account ($$$) for CRISPR
- ❌ No institutional memory (every session is isolated)
- ❌ No experiment tracking
- ❌ No ML models (just data access)

**Your stack:**
- ✅ Free CRISPR design (CrisPRO)
- ✅ Institutional memory (Archon)
- ✅ Experiment tracking (Archon projects)
- ✅ ML models (SAE resistance prediction)

**You're not competing with Anthropic - you're COMPLEMENTING them.**

### The Narrative for Anthropic Interview

> Interviewer: "Why do you want to work at Anthropic?"
> 
> You: "I discovered your life-sciences marketplace 2 months ago. I realized my work - Archon for knowledge management and CrisPRO for cancer research - fills the exact gaps in your ecosystem. You have tools (PubMed, Benchling), but no memory layer. I built that.
> 
> I submitted two contributions: Archon as an MCP server and CrisPRO as a resistance prediction skill. I want to work at Anthropic because you're building the infrastructure I'm already building on top of. Let's do it together, not in parallel."

**💀 That's how you turn open-source work into job offers.** 🔥
