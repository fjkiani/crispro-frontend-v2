## 🎯 KEY UNDERSTANDINGS ACHIEVED

### **1. Strategic Vision** (100% Confidence):
- 85-90% of cancers are sporadic (not germline-positive)
- 5.6x larger addressable market
- Paradigm shift: Germline-centric → Tumor-centric
- Competitive advantage: Sporadic-first approach

### **2. Platform Architecture** (95% Confidence):
- Three-tier backend (Minimal + AI Services)
- Modular router pattern (30+ routers)
- Service layer separation (20+ services)
- Feature flags for different modes
- Graceful degradation patterns

### **3. S/P/E Framework** (100% Confidence):
- **Sequence (S)**: Evo2 delta scores, multi-window, symmetry, calibration (30% weight)
- **Pathway (P)**: Gene-to-pathway mapping, weighted aggregation (40% weight)
- **Evidence (E)**: Literature (PubMed), ClinVar priors, MoA alignment (30% weight)
- **Sporadic Gates**: PARP penalty/rescue, IO boost, confidence capping

### **4. Clinical Systems** (95% Confidence):
- **WIWFM**: Drug efficacy prediction with S/P/E
- **Trials**: Sporadic-aware matching (exclude germline-required)
- **SOC**: NCCN-aligned recommendations
- **CA-125**: Early resistance detection
- **Food**: Treatment line intelligence
- **Resistance**: Proactive detection

### **5. Data Flow** (95% Confidence):
- Frontend → Backend (HTTP POST with JSON)
- Backend → AI Services (HTTP POST to Modal URLs)
- Backend → External APIs (PubMed, ClinVar, etc.)
- Caching: Redis → Memory fallback
- Error propagation: Graceful degradation

### **6. Development Patterns** (95% Confidence):
- **"Wet Noodle" Doctrine**: Multi-dimensional validation mandatory
- **Triumvirate Protocol**: Truncation check before Evo2
- **Backend Orchestrator Pattern**: Single orchestrator endpoint
- **Generative vs Inference Paradigm**: Digital Twin → Predict → Generate

### **7. Product Capabilities** (95% Confidence):
- 6 Capability Groups (Clinical, Research, Design, Intelligence, Conversational, Enterprise)
- 12 Competitive Advantages (transparent reasoning, deterministic confidence, etc.)
- Customer Benefits (Oncologists, Biotechs, Researchers, Clinical Trial Teams)

### **8. Research & Design** (90% Confidence):
- **VUS Explorer**: Variant interpretation
- **Hypothesis Validator**: Universal compound testing
- **Metastasis Interception**: CRISPR guide design
- **CRISPR Design**: Guide RNA efficacy prediction
- **Evidence RAG**: Conversational literature search

### **9. Execution Strategy** (95% Confidence):
- 7-day build plan
- Ayesha case study (real-world example)
- Smoke tests (4 scenarios)
- Test command reference

### **10. Agent Architecture** (85% Confidence):
- Agent router, manager, executor, scheduler
- Agent types (PubMed Sentinel, Trial Scout, VUS Vigil)
- Agent workflows (scheduled, on-demand)
- Agent missions for Ayesha
