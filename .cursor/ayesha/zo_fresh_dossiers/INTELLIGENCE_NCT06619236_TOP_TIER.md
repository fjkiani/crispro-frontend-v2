## 🎯 WHY THIS TRIAL IS A GOOD FIT FOR AYESHA (LLM Analysis)

### **Clinical Analysis of NCT06619236 for Ayesha Kiani**

**TO:** Ayesha Kiani's Care Team
**FROM:** Clinical Oncology Expert
**DATE:** October 26, 2023
**RE:** Eligibility and Suitability Analysis for Trial NCT06619236

This analysis concludes that trial NCT06619236 is **not an appropriate option** for Ayesha Kiani at this time. The fundamental mismatch between her treatment-naive status and the trial's focus on platinum-resistant, recurrent disease makes her ineligible and renders the intervention clinically inappropriate as a first-line therapy.

---

#### **1. Drug Mechanism Fit**

The investigational agent, Rina-S (Rinatabart sesutecan), is a Folate Receptor alpha (FRα)-targeting antibody-drug conjugate (ADC). This mechanism is highly relevant for HGSOC, as FRα is overexpressed in a majority of these tumors. The ADC is designed to deliver a potent topoisomerase inhibitor payload directly to cancer cells, theoretically sparing normal tissue and overcoming certain resistance mechanisms.

However, the clinical context is paramount. ADCs like Rina-S are being studied for patients whose disease has progressed after standard platinum-based chemotherapy. For Ayesha, who is treatment-naive, the established first-line standard is a platinum doublet. Her extensive tumor burden and high CA-125 are indicative of a chemosensitive disease that is expected to respond well to initial platinum therapy. Introducing a later-line agent now would be a significant deviation from evidence-based care and would squander the most effective initial treatment strategy.

#### **2. Location Logistics**

While logistically feasible, this is secondary to clinical ineligibility. From her East Harlem ZIP code (10029), several trial sites are accessible:

*   **NYP-Weill Cornell Medical Center:** Excellent proximity (15-25 minutes via public transit/car).
*   **Perlmutter Cancer Center - 38th Street:** Accessible (30-45 minutes via subway).
*   **Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center (Columbia):** Accessible (30-40 minutes via subway).
*   **Perlmutter at NYU Langone - Long Island:** Not a practical option due to significant travel time.
*   **Mount Sinai (Miami Beach, FL):** Not a local site. Note: Mount Sinai's main campus in NYC is not listed as a site for this trial.

The availability of sites at major NYC academic centers is a strength of the trial, but it does not overcome the primary issue of ineligibility.

#### **3. Risk-Benefit for Ayesha**

The risk-benefit calculation is overwhelmingly negative for Ayesha in this context.

*   **Benefit:** There is no clinical benefit to forgoing a highly effective first-line standard of care for a second- or third-line experimental therapy. The response rates to agents used in the platinum-resistant setting are significantly lower than those expected from first-line carboplatin/paclitaxel.
*   **Risk:** The primary risk is the loss of the best opportunity for a deep and durable remission. Delaying or skipping standard front-line therapy would almost certainly lead to a worse clinical outcome. Furthermore, her compromised pulmonary status from large pleural effusions poses a specific risk. ADCs can carry a risk of interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis. While often a low-frequency event, it would be a devastating complication in a patient with pre-existing pulmonary compromise. Her planned SOC, particularly with bevacizumab, is better suited to manage and resolve malignant pleural effusions.

#### **4. Comparison to Standard of Care (SOC)**

This trial is not a valid alternative or complement to Ayesha's planned SOC.

*   **Planned SOC (Carboplatin + Paclitaxel + Bevacizumab):** This is the gold standard for a patient with Stage IVB HGSOC and extensive tumor burden. It has a high objective response rate (>75%) and is the established backbone of front-line therapy. The addition of bevacizumab is particularly indicated for her, as it can help control malignant effusions and has been shown to improve progression-free survival in the front-line setting.
*   **Trial Intervention (Rina-S vs. Investigator's Choice Chemo):** This trial compares an experimental agent against single-agent chemotherapies (e.g., weekly paclitaxel, PLD) used for *platinum-resistant disease*. These comparator agents have response rates in the 15-25% range. Enrolling in this trial would mean receiving a therapy that is unequivocally inferior to her planned SOC.

#### **5. Critical Considerations for the Care Team**

1.  **Ineligibility is Definitive:** The core eligibility criteria requiring **1 to 4 prior lines of therapy** and documented **radiographic progression** immediately disqualify Ayesha. This is not a borderline case.

2.  **Prioritize Standard of Care:** The immediate clinical priority should be to initiate her planned SOC of Carboplatin/Paclitaxel/Bevacizumab as soon as her pleural effusions are medically managed (e.g., via thoracentesis) to stabilize her pulmonary status.

3.  **Complete Biomarker Testing:** It is critical to obtain Homologous Recombination Deficiency (HRD) status. If her tumor is HRD-positive (even if BRCA-negative), she would be a candidate for maintenance therapy with a PARP inhibitor (olaparib) in combination with bevacizumab following chemotherapy, which can significantly extend her progression-free survival.

4.  **Future Trial Consideration:** This trial, and others like it for platinum-resistant disease, may become relevant for Ayesha in the future *if* her disease recurs and demonstrates platinum resistance. For now, the focus must remain on optimizing her first-line treatment.

## 📊 TRIAL DESCRIPTION

This phase 3 study will be conducted in different countries all over the world.

The purpose of this study is to compare how well Rina-S works against platinum-resistant ovarian cancer compared to chemotherapy drugs that are already approved and used for platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.

Treatment in this study could be Rina-S or it could be 1 of 4 indicated chemotherapy agents that are considered standard medical care. There is an equal (50:50) chance of getting Rina-S or an approved chemotherapy agent as treatment in this study. No one will know what treatment they are assigned to until the first dose.

All participants will receive active drug; no one will be given placebo.
