**Category**: pattern
**Priority**: P2
**Source**: Chat log lines 107-188

---


AGENT 3 (SCIENTIST):
  PRIMARY: S4 - Data source mapping (8 hours)
    - Identify treatment cohorts with serial CA-125
    - Priority: GOG-218, ICON7, CHIVA, GCIG meta-analysis
    - Contact info for collaborators (KELIM, Institut Curie)
    - Draft outreach emails (use D4 protocol templates)
    - OUTPUT: Ranked list of cohorts + access strategy
  
  SECONDARY: S2 completion (6 hours remaining)
    - Finish pathway-kinetic matrix
    - 20-30 pairs from literature
    - Feed into S3 (hypotheses)
  
  TIMELINE: 14 hours total (spread over 1-2 weeks)
  BLOCKING: None (literature-based work)

AGENT 1 (THERAPY FIT):
  STATUS: On hold (Week 3-4 execution)
  RATIONALE: 
    - Agents 2+3 focused on Resistance Prophet infrastructure
    - WIWFM validation can wait (proven framework, low risk)
    - Execute when RP infrastructure built (avoid bandwidth split)
```

### **Week 2-3 (Jan 10-17): PLCO Approved (Expected)**

DECISION GATE: PLCO approval status

IF PLCO APPROVED (Expected Jan 2-6):
  
  AGENT 2 (ENGINEER):
    A1: Download PLCO data (1 day)
    A2: Extract serial CA-125 + outcomes (2 days)
      - ovar_screen.csv → serial CA-125 measurements
      - ovar.csv → cancer outcomes (72 cases)
      - Merge by plco_id, compute lead times
    A3: Validate CA-125 kinetics (3-5 days)
      - Compute velocity, acceleration, KELIM-like scores
      - Train models (logistic regression, random forest)
      - Evaluate AUROC, sensitivity, specificity
      - Compare: Baseline vs kinetics vs combined
    
    OUTPUT: PLCO Kinetics Validation Report
      - AUROC for cancer detection (target: 0.65-0.75)
      - Lead time analysis (how early kinetics detect)
      - Proof: Kinetics layer works for onset detection
    
    TIMELINE: 6-8 days (Jan 10-17)
  
  AGENT 3 (SCIENTIST):
    PARALLEL: Contact collaborators (S4 execution)
      - Email KELIM developers (biomarker-kinetics.org)
      - Contact Institut Curie (GCIG meta-analysis)
      - Reach out to GOG-218/ICON7 trial investigators
      - Request treatment cohort data
    
    DELIVERABLE: Collaborator outreach campaign
      - 5-10 emails sent
      - Response tracking (2-4 weeks typical)
      - Backup plan if all decline (Project Data Sphere)
    
    TIMELINE: 2-3 days (Jan 10-12)

IF PLCO NOT APPROVED YET:
  - Continue building harness (Agent 2)
  - Continue S4 execution (Agent 3)
  - Reassess Jan 10-12
```
