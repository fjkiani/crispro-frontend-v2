Cancer isn't a static genome—it's a population under selection. I can predict which genes drive metastasis and which drugs match a patient's variants at diagnosis. What I cannot predict is how tumor subclones evolve resistance, which escape routes they'll take under therapeutic pressure, or when to switch therapies as clonal fitness landscapes shift. That's an evolutionary biology problem, not an engineering problem.

This isn't abstract. My sister Ayesha is on PARP inhibitor therapy for stage IV ovarian cancer, and I need to know whether to expect resistance—and when.

By December 2025, I'd submitted two computational oncology abstracts to AACR that reflect how I work: build biological models, validate them against measurable criteria, and communicate results with scientific rigor. The first manuscript—"Metastasis Interception Through Stage-Specific CRISPR Guide Design"—used AlphaFold 3 to structurally validate guide:DNA complexes and enforce acceptance criteria (pLDDT ≥50, iPTM ≥0.30) across 15 designs, achieving AUROC 0.976 for target gene prioritization across eight metastatic steps. The second manuscript—"Multi-Modal Drug Efficacy Prediction in Multiple Myeloma"—showed that pathway context is necessary for drug-gene matching: in a focused validation set of MAPK variants, ablation of the pathway layer degraded ranking performance.

But both systems share the same limitation: they reason at a single timepoint. When I validated the metastasis framework against published cell line observations, BRAF knockdown in melanoma selected for NRAS-driven escape within weeks. The model correctly prioritized BRAF as essential—but could not predict the compensatory route. Similarly, the drug-efficacy model can identify DDR vulnerabilities at diagnosis, yet it cannot forecast which resistant subclone will dominate months into therapy.

I've validated related risk markers at cohort scale: in 995 multiple myeloma patients, DIS3 mutations predicted 2.08× mortality risk (p=0.0145); in 469 ovarian cancer patients, MAPK mutations predicted 1.97× platinum resistance (p<0.05). These are meaningful signals—but they are still static flags. They do not model how clonal populations shift under selection, when a fitness landscape flips, or how to time a switch in therapy.

I'm applying to Richard Gilder Graduate School because I need phylogenetic methods for clonal lineage tracing from longitudinal sequencing data, selection analysis frameworks to quantify fitness coefficients for resistant clones, and comparative genomics to identify conserved escape mechanisms across cancers. I need to stop treating tumors as snapshots and start modeling them as evolving populations.

I graduated from John Jay College with a 2.7 GPA after eleven years, failing chemistry twice. I wasn't ready for rigorous STEM at eighteen. I needed a why.

In June 2023, I got one.

Ayesha was diagnosed with stage IV ovarian cancer. Her genomic testing came back with a puzzle I couldn't find in any clinical guideline: a germline MBD4 frameshift (p.Ile413Serfs*2)—so rare it had no treatment recommendations—combined with somatic TP53 R175H and high-burden features consistent with DNA repair stress. No trial or guideline cleanly fit her combination. Her oncologist asked what I thought we should try.

I taught myself genomics to analyze her tumor, built an eight-question clinical analysis framework, and traced the biology to a mechanistic hypothesis: MBD4 deficiency can create synthetic lethality with TP53 through DNA damage repair collapse—BRCA-like vulnerability through base excision repair loss rather than homologous recombination. PARP inhibitors became a viable option not because a guideline recommended them, but because the pathway biology supported it.

The deeper insight wasn't one drug for one patient. It was that MBD4 loss is context-dependent: protective in MSI-high settings with intact homologous recombination, yet lethal in HR-deficient backgrounds like Ayesha's. The same mutation can imply opposite outcomes depending on genetic context. That is why I began building comparative frameworks rather than single-case interpretations.

I founded CrisPRO.ai to scale this approach. By December 2025, the platform integrated multi-modal VUS triage in DDR pathway genes critical for PARP eligibility (BRCA1/2, RAD51C/D, PALB2, ATM, CHEK2, MBD4), combining sequence disruption scoring (Evo2), pathway context, and clinical evidence to classify variants that ClinVar leaves non-decisive. We also built mechanism-based trial matching using 7D pathway vectors and resistance detection signals such as DNA repair restoration and pathway escape.

But building the platform revealed its own limitation. I can extract pathway-level features (including SAE-derived embeddings), detect resistance signals, and rank therapies by mechanism fit. What I cannot do is model how Ayesha's clonal populations will evolve under PARP inhibitor pressure: when a pathway-escape signal appears, I can recognize it, but I cannot quantify the fitness coefficient, reconstruct the lineage origin, or predict when it will dominate. That is evolutionary dynamics.

---

Across my work, I validate models the way biologists validate claims: by matching predictions to measurable criteria, stress-testing assumptions, and documenting failure modes.

In "Metastasis Interception Through Stage-Specific CRISPR Guide Design," I treated metastasis as a sequence of distinct biological steps rather than a single monolith. I built a prioritization framework spanning eight steps—EMT initiation, invasion, circulation survival, extravasation, dormancy escape, and colonization—and integrated sequence-level disruption scoring (Evo2), pathway essentiality signals, and structural validation. Using AlphaFold 3, I enforced acceptance criteria (pLDDT ≥50, iPTM ≥0.30) across 15 guide:DNA complexes and achieved AUROC 0.976 for target gene prioritization.

In "Multi-Modal Drug Efficacy Prediction in Multiple Myeloma," I built a framework unifying sequence disruption, pathway aggregation, and evidence integration. Ablation studies showed pathway context materially changes drug ranking. I extended this framework to the clinical pain point of VUS: in DDR genes that gate PARP eligibility, I used Evo2 disruption signals plus pathway context to classify variants that ClinVar leaves non-decisive, generating auditable receipts (including RAD51C variants with strong disruption signals).

Finally, I built resistance detection as a multi-signal system rather than a single-marker classifier, incorporating features such as DNA repair restoration and pathway escape. Cohort-scale validations anchored this direction, while making the limitation explicit: I can detect that selection is happening, but I cannot yet reconstruct lineage history or forecast clonal dominance.

Taken together, these projects show I can integrate sequence, structure, pathways, evidence, and resistance signals into validated systems. They also clarify what I now need: evolutionary theory and phylogenetic methods to move from static prediction to dynamic modeling of clonal trajectories.

I need to answer four questions that engineering alone cannot solve.

**How do I model clonal evolution under drug selection?**

CrisPRO's resistance prediction system flags risk markers at diagnosis. But those are static. When Ayesha continues PARP inhibitor therapy, I need to forecast not just *if* resistance will emerge, but *which* resistant clone will outcompete others and *when*. I need stochastic birth-death models for clonal competition, Bayesian inference frameworks to estimate clonal fitness from single-cell sequencing data, and Wright-Fisher models to predict which subclones will dominate under specific drug selection pressures.

**When did cancer acquire the escape mechanisms I'm trying to block?**

My metastasis framework targets eight steps—but I don't know which pathways are evolutionarily ancient (and therefore hard to bypass) versus recently acquired (and therefore plastic). If EMT programs are deeply conserved across vertebrates, tumor cells may have limited escape routes from EMT-targeting CRISPR guides. If dormancy mechanisms are evolutionarily young, they may admit compensatory pathways I haven't identified. I need phylogenetic comparative methods to distinguish conserved vulnerabilities from plastic ones.

**How do I design therapeutic schedules that account for clonal dynamics?**

If Ayesha continues with PARP inhibitors, which resistant subclone will dominate at six months—HR restoration through RAD51C reactivation, or drug efflux through ABCB1 upregulation? I need quantitative frameworks for sequential drug scheduling informed by evolutionary game theory, where each drug applies different selection pressures and the optimal sequence minimizes the probability of multi-drug resistant clones emerging.

**How do I validate evolutionary predictions in real patients?**

I've validated static predictions in 1,464 cancer patients. But Ayesha's tumor will be sequenced again at 6 months and 12 months under therapy. I need phylogenetic methods to reconstruct her clonal lineage tree from longitudinal sequencing, dN/dS analysis to detect whether her resistant subclones are under positive selection, and population genetics frameworks to quantify selection coefficients before resistant clones dominate.

These questions require formal evolutionary biology training—not just better algorithms.

Richard Gilder Graduate School is one of the few programs where rigorous evolutionary biology training is embedded in a museum-scale comparative genomics environment—and where I can connect those tools back to clinically meaningful questions.

I am particularly excited by the work of Dr. Robert DeSalle on phylogenetic bioinformatics and genome-wide comparative genomics, Dr. Brian T. Smith on phylogenomic analysis and statistical modeling of evolutionary dynamics, and Dr. Frank T. Burbrink on comparative genomics and positive selection analysis. I want to apply their methods to reconstruct clonal lineage trees from longitudinal tumor sequencing, quantify selection on resistance pathways, and test whether vulnerabilities like DNA repair epistasis are conserved across vertebrates (and therefore harder for tumors to bypass) or evolutionarily plastic (and therefore prone to compensatory escape).

I bring validated computational infrastructure (CrisPRO.ai) already deployed in clinical research collaborations, along with longitudinal sequencing data from ongoing patient cases including Ayesha's. I am not starting from scratch—I'm bringing tools and data that can immediately interface with the Museum's evolutionary biology training.

The Museum's tissue archives and computational resources enable comparative evolutionary studies at scale, while the broader New York biomedical ecosystem creates opportunities for translational collaboration. I am looking for a program that can train me to treat cancer as an evolving population—and to build models that are both scientifically rigorous and clinically relevant.
