## 4. TRIAL DESCRIPTION

There are more and more PARPi(PARP inhibitors) resistance for ovarian cancer patients after previous use of PARP inhibitors. Basic studies have found that there is synergistic effect of bevacizumab combined with PARPi. Therefore we designed the study to include 42 ovarian cancer patients who had PARPi for at least half a year and then relapsed (platinum-sensitive, previously 1-3 lines of chemotherapy). After getting complete remission or partial remission with chemotherapy containing platinum and bevacizumab, fluzopanib and bevacizumab were used for maintenance treatment. The progression-free survival, ORR, DCR, DoR, and safety were evaluated based on RECIST V1.1.
